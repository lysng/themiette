Here we meet and say farewell to August and September — as usual, time escapes us. One moment we were just getting into the rhythm of things, and the next, we were wrapped up in the chaos of the month with everything bleeding into September. Our friends got married, we went up north and we enjoyed concerts but perhaps the biggest distraction — and a speedy luxury — was the opening of the new Metro in our area! It’s a bit trivial, but it cuts the commute time by 50% and allows us to fit in more life into our days. Lys has been a bit of slack on the documenting of tiny house moments recently in the pursuit of finishing things, but August saw us finish our storage loft!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>February and March Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2024-feb-mar-build-update/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Apr 2024 14:51:27 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2024-feb-mar-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well hello there, long time no write.

&lt;p>To begin, in February, our tiny house project took a bit of a breather, allowing us to indulge in some personal pursuits. Erny played some Frisbee, which offered a welcome break from the tiny house grind. Lys bought a new second hand road-bike and promptly caught COVID-19. Writing and reflecting on this now, it really does feel like an eon ago. Construction wise, we finished the diagonal portion of the outside wall and Evan gifted us some privacy vinyl for our windows.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Jan Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2024-jan-build-update/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2024 11:08:26 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2024-jan-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="our-first-update-for-2024">Our first update for 2024!&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>2024 has well and truly started with what feels like a huge January. Among the noteworthy developments was new eye protection! But jokes aside, we got some new eye-glasses from Bunnings and these are crystal clear with exceptional comfort, with Erny forgetting that they’re even on his face or on his head. They have swiftly become an indispensable asset — and it’s the little things, you know?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Final Update For 2023</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-final-build-update/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 11:08:26 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-final-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="our-last-2023-build-update">Our Last 2023 Build Update&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Hello and happy new year! We hope your break was filled with relaxation and joy. Ours was a mix of hard work and a few breakthroughs in our tiny house project. Let&amp;rsquo;s catch you up on our latest adventures.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Did anyone experience hail in your area? We were, once again, in a relentless race against daylight and unpredictable weather. The elements threw everything at us, from rain to scorching 40-degree days, and even a hail spell! Erny spent most of the break looking at the Weatherzone app to make sure we would always be in the clear. Even with these curveballs, over Christmas, our tiny house saw significant progress.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>November Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-nov-build-update/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Dec 2023 11:08:26 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-nov-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="a-november-build-update">A November build update&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Greetings from our ever-evolving construction site! November has been a month of highs, lows, and, of course, more cladding adventures. So, grab your virtual hard hat, and let&amp;rsquo;s dive into the nitty-gritty details.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Our journey begins with drumroll… putting finishing touches on a wall, and oh, what a journey it has been. The internal debate raged on: to cover the corner where cladding meets, should we go with Surfmist steel corner flashing or the charm of contrasting wood trim? In the end, the warmth of wood won us over, embracing its subtle curves and warps over time. We kicked things off by cutting and installing some Douglas fir corners. It might not be as durable as steel, but it looks undeniably great! These corners were definitely a challenge to install as we started using those beautiful yet painful brass screws. We bought these in June if you, dear reader, remember and now making they were grand debut.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>September October Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-sep-oct-build-update/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 11:08:26 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-sep-oct-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="a-september-holiday-and-an-october-build-update">A September holiday and an October build update&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>The past months have been a whirlwind of adventure, starting with a journey to the United States for a wedding - congratulations Visrut and Ruhani! We travelled from Australia to the U.S. and embarked on an adventure that took us from the vibrant streets of New Orleans all the way to the iconic city of New York. Along the way, we had the pleasure of exploring the stunning natural beauty of the Smoky Mountains National Park. Our hike along a small section of the Appalachian Trail was a definite highlight. A huge shout-out to Kat, Erny&amp;rsquo;s frisbee friend, for being our guide and teaching us about hemlock, spruce, and fir trees.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>July Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-jul-build-update/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jul 2023 11:08:26 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-jul-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="a-july-build-update">A July build update&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>July has been window month. We are pretty proud to say that we&amp;rsquo;ve now got our hand made windows installed 🙂 - here is how it went!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We began with the bathroom window, which we thought would be a breeze. However, not even one window down we faced our first hiccup - it turns out the width of the window frame was not wide enough to run flush with the internal lining of the tiny house (on the inside) and flush with the exterior cladding on the outside. We were 8 mm short! Talk about a stressful first window weekend. After some deliberation we decided that we would cut an angle into our internal lining and make it a feature. This means that the exterior cladding will be flush giving a more waterproof seal, and we will have to get creative when we tackle the interior. Bar this - the bathroom window went in without a hitch!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>June Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-jun-build-update/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jun 2023 11:08:26 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-jun-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="a-june-build-update">A June build update&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>The tail end of May and the month of June have been quite eventful, filled with a lot of shopping and unexpected visitors from far away states. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive right in!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our fanciest acquisition was a package of flathead brass screws that arrived in the mail. While elegant in appearance, they present a formidable challenge due to their soft composition and that flatheads are known for slipping and causing drills to gouge the timber. Every person that Lys shares this purchase with is flabbergasted on the screw choice - why pick something so challenging to work with? It turns out that inspiration can strike at any moment, and Lys found hers while passing through a fancy neighbourhood. She spotted a garage door adorned with western red cedar facing and beautiful brass nails. The sight left a lasting impression, but clearly Lys didn&amp;rsquo;t realise exactly what she was getting into&amp;hellip;we will see how we fare.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>August September 2022 Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/aug-sep-2022-build-update/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Oct 2022 13:54:47 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/aug-sep-2022-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="an-august-september-build-update">An August September build update&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>We went through our stash of 90x45mm lengths and picked out roof rafters. These have been measured down to a 20 degree angle and some have been cut to size! We&amp;rsquo;ve been doing this in the garage when there has been a rain shower break and it has worked quite well. Erny created a little jig to speed up the process and it has been great get that out of the way.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
