&lt;p>As Lys sits down to write this she can officially say that we have sourced all of our roof components! It is a mixture of second hand material and some first-hand non-negotiable(s) but it&amp;rsquo;s great to finally have all the bits and bobs.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We chose to have a slightly off centred gable roof for our tiny house. Technically this is known as a saltbox pitch style but we have not found that term used commonly in Australia. We wanted to keep the &lt;code>traditional house&lt;/code> style compared to some of the more modern tiny house options. The style is also quite useful for maximising solar panels on a small space and this will be helpful if we decide to go off-grid. It is also simple to construct as there are minimal valleys or curves which makes it great for novice builders also known as &lt;strong>cough&lt;/strong> us.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
