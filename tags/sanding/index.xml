&lt;p>The tail end of May and the month of June have been quite eventful, filled with a lot of shopping and unexpected visitors from far away states. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive right in!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our fanciest acquisition was a package of flathead brass screws that arrived in the mail. While elegant in appearance, they present a formidable challenge due to their soft composition and that flatheads are known for slipping and causing drills to gouge the timber. Every person that Lys shares this purchase with is flabbergasted on the screw choice - why pick something so challenging to work with? It turns out that inspiration can strike at any moment, and Lys found hers while passing through a fancy neighbourhood. She spotted a garage door adorned with western red cedar facing and beautiful brass nails. The sight left a lasting impression, but clearly Lys didn&amp;rsquo;t realise exactly what she was getting into&amp;hellip;we will see how we fare.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
