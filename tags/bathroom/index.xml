We hope you&amp;rsquo;ve had a restive festive season ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ‰. Time doesnâ€™t just fly â€” it seems to sprint when youâ€™re building a tiny house.

Looking back, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe how quickly time has flown by. April and May seem like distant memories, and now, here we are, well into&amp;hellip;July. But we havenâ€™t been sleeping and not working â€” let me take you through the latest updates and progress we&amp;rsquo;ve made during these transformative months.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
