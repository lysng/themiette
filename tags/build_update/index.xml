Here we meet and say farewell to August and September — as usual, time escapes us. One moment we were just getting into the rhythm of things, and the next, we were wrapped up in the chaos of the month with everything bleeding into September. Our friends got married, we went up north and we enjoyed concerts but perhaps the biggest distraction — and a speedy luxury — was the opening of the new Metro in our area! It’s a bit trivial, but it cuts the commute time by 50% and allows us to fit in more life into our days. Lys has been a bit of slack on the documenting of tiny house moments recently in the pursuit of finishing things, but August saw us finish our storage loft!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>June July Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2024-june-july-build-update/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2024 18:20:37 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2024-june-july-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello! It’s another double month build update, not by design but by necessity as we have been working hard to make this tiny house more of a reality. June saw us work on our kitchen cabinets while we wait for the professionals and buying an HRV system, and July saw us getting all our insulation done! We watched many hours of Tour de France and as Lys writes this the Olympics is on in the background, so we are feeling very inspired watching others achieve their goals. Let’s dive right in!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>April and May Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2024-apr-may-build-update/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jul 2024 13:04:21 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2024-apr-may-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>My goodness hasn’t it been a time — feels like we haven’t written a post in a long time.

&lt;p>To begin, in February, our tiny house project took a bit of a breather, allowing us to indulge in some personal pursuits. Erny played some Frisbee, which offered a welcome break from the tiny house grind. Lys bought a new second hand road-bike and promptly caught COVID-19. Writing and reflecting on this now, it really does feel like an eon ago. Construction wise, we finished the diagonal portion of the outside wall and Evan gifted us some privacy vinyl for our windows.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Jan Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2024-jan-build-update/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2024 11:08:26 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2024-jan-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="our-first-update-for-2024">Our first update for 2024!&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>2024 has well and truly started with what feels like a huge January. Among the noteworthy developments was new eye protection! But jokes aside, we got some new eye-glasses from Bunnings and these are crystal clear with exceptional comfort, with Erny forgetting that they’re even on his face or on his head. They have swiftly become an indispensable asset — and it’s the little things, you know?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Final Update For 2023</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-final-build-update/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 11:08:26 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-final-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="our-last-2023-build-update">Our Last 2023 Build Update&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Did anyone experience hail in your area? We were, once again, in a relentless race against daylight and unpredictable weather. The elements threw everything at us, from rain to scorching 40-degree days, and even a hail spell! Erny spent most of the break looking at the Weatherzone app to make sure we would always be in the clear. Even with these curveballs, over Christmas, our tiny house saw significant progress.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>November Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-nov-build-update/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Dec 2023 11:08:26 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-nov-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="a-november-build-update">A November build update&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Greetings from our ever-evolving construction site! November has been a month of highs, lows, and, of course, more cladding adventures. So, grab your virtual hard hat, and let&amp;rsquo;s dive into the nitty-gritty details.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Our journey begins with drumroll… putting finishing touches on a wall, and oh, what a journey it has been. The internal debate raged on: to cover the corner where cladding meets, should we go with Surfmist steel corner flashing or the charm of contrasting wood trim? In the end, the warmth of wood won us over, embracing its subtle curves and warps over time. We kicked things off by cutting and installing some Douglas fir corners. It might not be as durable as steel, but it looks undeniably great! These corners were definitely a challenge to install as we started using those beautiful yet painful brass screws. We bought these in June if you, dear reader, remember and now making they were grand debut.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>September October Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-sep-oct-build-update/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 11:08:26 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-sep-oct-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="a-september-holiday-and-an-october-build-update">A September holiday and an October build update&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>The past months have been a whirlwind of adventure, starting with a journey to the United States for a wedding - congratulations Visrut and Ruhani! We travelled from Australia to the U.S. and embarked on an adventure that took us from the vibrant streets of New Orleans all the way to the iconic city of New York. Along the way, we had the pleasure of exploring the stunning natural beauty of the Smoky Mountains National Park. Our hike along a small section of the Appalachian Trail was a definite highlight. A huge shout-out to Kat, Erny&amp;rsquo;s frisbee friend, for being our guide and teaching us about hemlock, spruce, and fir trees.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>August Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-aug-build-update/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Sep 2023 11:08:26 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-aug-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="an-august-build-update">An August build update&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re back with another exciting update from our construction escapades. August has been a whirlwind of challenges, cleaning, and mad dash purchases but we&amp;rsquo;ve managed to make some significant roofing progress on our tiny house.

&lt;h4 id="what-weve-done">What we&amp;rsquo;ve done&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>As we kicked off August, we found ourselves juggling two passions: our relentless dedication to our tiny house project (read as: desperation to finish the roof before we leave for the US) and the thrilling tension of the Women&amp;rsquo;s World Cup (go the Matildas!). Our multitasking skills were put to the test as we cheered for our favourite teams while meticulously measuring and constructing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>July Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-jul-build-update/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jul 2023 11:08:26 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-jul-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="a-july-build-update">A July build update&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>July has been window month. We are pretty proud to say that we&amp;rsquo;ve now got our hand made windows installed 🙂 - here is how it went!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We began with the bathroom window, which we thought would be a breeze. However, not even one window down we faced our first hiccup - it turns out the width of the window frame was not wide enough to run flush with the internal lining of the tiny house (on the inside) and flush with the exterior cladding on the outside. We were 8 mm short! Talk about a stressful first window weekend. After some deliberation we decided that we would cut an angle into our internal lining and make it a feature. This means that the exterior cladding will be flush giving a more waterproof seal, and we will have to get creative when we tackle the interior. Bar this - the bathroom window went in without a hitch!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>June Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-jun-build-update/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jun 2023 11:08:26 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-jun-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="a-june-build-update">A June build update&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>The tail end of May and the month of June have been quite eventful, filled with a lot of shopping and unexpected visitors from far away states. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive right in!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our fanciest acquisition was a package of flathead brass screws that arrived in the mail. While elegant in appearance, they present a formidable challenge due to their soft composition and that flatheads are known for slipping and causing drills to gouge the timber. Every person that Lys shares this purchase with is flabbergasted on the screw choice - why pick something so challenging to work with? It turns out that inspiration can strike at any moment, and Lys found hers while passing through a fancy neighbourhood. She spotted a garage door adorned with western red cedar facing and beautiful brass nails. The sight left a lasting impression, but clearly Lys didn&amp;rsquo;t realise exactly what she was getting into&amp;hellip;we will see how we fare.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>May Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-may-build-update/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2023 11:08:26 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-may-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="an-may-build-update">An May build update&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Hello, hello! As May rolls on, the days are getting shorter, and our productivity has slowed down. Not to make this blog become a &lt;code>Let's complain about the weather&lt;/code> blog, but with the weather changing, we&amp;rsquo;ve had to battle with the elements to get any work done. Sunny weekdays are always followed by rainy weekends, leaving us only a few good hours to work on our project. To find a silver lining, we have become masters of water management though - devising a very high tech system of tarps and buckets to ensure minimal pooling.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>April Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-apr-build-update/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Apr 2023 11:08:26 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-apr-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="an-april-build-update">An April build update&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>What a hectic last few days! Erny and I took some time off to focus on the tiny house full-time over the Easter break. For us, the past week has been a rollercoaster ride of highs and lows, with the weather constantly threatening to rain on our parade. It has been a lesson in patience, and willingness to adapt and learning as we go. But we&amp;rsquo;ve soldiered on, and I&amp;rsquo;m proud to say that we&amp;rsquo;ve made some significant progress - we can&amp;rsquo;t wait to update you!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>March Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/mar-2023-build-update/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Apr 2023 11:08:26 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/mar-2023-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="a-march-build-update">A March build update&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Hello from The Miette HQ! The last half of February and March has been a busy and productive month for Erny and Lys, and thanks to an unseasonably dry month on the coast we have made some great progress on the tiny.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We kicked off the month by refurbishing our 40-year-old door. We had been looking for a narrow external french door for a while and rescued this gem from a renovation down south. The door had quite a bit of - let us say &lt;em>character&lt;/em>, but the glass was intact, the wood in great condition and the correct dimensions! We got to work sanding down the varnish and stain and this time, compared to the windows it was an absolute breeze.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>January Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/jan-2023-build-update/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2023 11:08:26 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/jan-2023-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="a-january-build-update">A January build update&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>In December last year Lys&amp;rsquo; parents gently highlighted that they want their garage back. So, with a deadline of September 30th and some wonderful sunshine we decided to nail these windows down. Honestly, we try write these blogs once a month but sometimes its difficult to encapsulate every trial and tribulation when you cannot even begin to remember them all. Over December and January we worked on the windows over the Christmas break and over 4 weekends, with each day throwing up a new challenge.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>November December Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/nov-dec-2022-build-update/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 11:08:26 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/nov-dec-2022-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="an-november-december-build-update">An November December build update&lt;/h3>

We&amp;rsquo;ve been doing this in the garage when there has been a rain shower break and it has worked quite well. Erny created a little jig to speed up the process and it has been great get that out of the way.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>July 2022 Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/july-2022-build-update/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Aug 2022 20:15:04 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/july-2022-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="a-july-build-update">A July build update&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>What have we done? Absolutely nothing. Lys honestly thinks it&amp;rsquo;s been the wettest July that we&amp;rsquo;ve lived through in sunny Australia.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Erny jetted off to the US for a few weeks to play ultimate frisbee! Left to her own devices Lys did a few sundry things like source suppliers for our metal connectors. We&amp;rsquo;ve also added a few new features to the site - now you can add comments and now subscribe if you feel so inclined. Is Lys using this project to learn some coding skills on the side? Maybe&amp;hellip;👀&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>June 2022 Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/june-2022-build-update/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jul 2022 23:15:04 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/june-2022-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="a-june-build-update">A June build update&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Decided that we should do monthly build updates as we march towards the end of the year. We&amp;rsquo;re hoping to reach lock up by then (walls, floor and roof complete) and 31st December is our D-day.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Erny bought a second hand table saw for $400 a few months back and it&amp;rsquo;s been an absolute workhorse. With it we&amp;rsquo;ve milled our wood down to size (70x45mm) for our walls and have started cutting down the blackbutt for our window frames.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
