Not really sure where all the time went, but let’s start in February and make our way through the months, shall we?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To begin, in February, our tiny house project took a bit of a breather, allowing us to indulge in some personal pursuits. Erny played some Frisbee, which offered a welcome break from the tiny house grind. Lys bought a new second hand road-bike and promptly caught COVID-19. Writing and reflecting on this now, it really does feel like an eon ago. Construction wise, we finished the diagonal portion of the outside wall and Evan gifted us some privacy vinyl for our windows.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Jan Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2024-jan-build-update/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2024 11:08:26 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2024-jan-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="our-first-update-for-2024">Our first update for 2024!&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>2024 has well and truly started with what feels like a huge January. Among the noteworthy developments was new eye protection! But jokes aside, we got some new eye-glasses from Bunnings and these are crystal clear with exceptional comfort, with Erny forgetting that they’re even on his face or on his head. They have swiftly become an indispensable asset — and it’s the little things, you know?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>April Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-apr-build-update/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Apr 2023 11:08:26 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-apr-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="an-april-build-update">An April build update&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>What a hectic last few days! Erny and I took some time off to focus on the tiny house full-time over the Easter break. For us, the past week has been a rollercoaster ride of highs and lows, with the weather constantly threatening to rain on our parade. It has been a lesson in patience, and willingness to adapt and learning as we go. But we&amp;rsquo;ve soldiered on, and I&amp;rsquo;m proud to say that we&amp;rsquo;ve made some significant progress - we can&amp;rsquo;t wait to update you!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>March Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/mar-2023-build-update/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Apr 2023 11:08:26 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/mar-2023-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="a-march-build-update">A March build update&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Hello from The Miette HQ! The last half of February and March has been a busy and productive month for Erny and Lys, and thanks to an unseasonably dry month on the coast we have made some great progress on the tiny.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We kicked off the month by refurbishing our 40-year-old door. We had been looking for a narrow external french door for a while and rescued this gem from a renovation down south. The door had quite a bit of - let us say &lt;em>character&lt;/em>, but the glass was intact, the wood in great condition and the correct dimensions! We got to work sanding down the varnish and stain and this time, compared to the windows it was an absolute breeze.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
