Here we meet and say farewell to August and September — as usual, time escapes us. One moment we were just getting into the rhythm of things, and the next, we were wrapped up in the chaos of the month with everything bleeding into September. Our friends got married, we went up north and we enjoyed concerts but perhaps the biggest distraction — and a speedy luxury — was the opening of the new Metro in our area! It’s a bit trivial, but it cuts the commute time by 50% and allows us to fit in more life into our days. Lys has been a bit of slack on the documenting of tiny house moments recently in the pursuit of finishing things, but August saw us finish our storage loft!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
