We hope you&amp;rsquo;ve had a restful festive season ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ‰. Time doesnâ€™t just fly â€” it seems to sprint when youâ€™re building a tiny house. Going to pack updates for October, November, and December in this build update, thereâ€™s been a lot more construction than reflection and writing. But, as we reminisce on the past three months, itâ€™s clear how much weâ€™ve accomplished, as we continue to chip away at our goals.
