We hope you&amp;rsquo;ve had a restful festive season 🎄🎉. Time doesn’t just fly — it seems to sprint when you’re building a tiny house. Going to pack updates for October, November, and December in this build update, there’s been a lot more construction than reflection and writing. But, as we reminisce on the past three months, it’s clear how much we’ve accomplished, as we continue to chip away at our goals. From plumbing adventures to detours into Passive House design and marathon plywood sessions, every moment has been filled with both sweat (thank you 34 °C degree days) and satisfaction (seeing the house fully closed up has been so cool!).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>June and July Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2024-june-july-build-update/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2024 18:20:37 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2024-june-july-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello! It’s another double month build update, not by design but by necessity as we have been working hard to make this tiny house more of a reality. June saw us work on our kitchen cabinets while we wait for the professionals and buying an HRV system, and July saw us getting all our insulation done! We watched many hours of Tour de France and as Lys writes this the Olympics is on in the background, so we are feeling very inspired watching others achieve their goals. Let’s dive right in!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>February and March Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2024-feb-mar-build-update/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Apr 2024 14:51:27 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2024-feb-mar-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well hello there, long time no write. Not really sure where all the time went, but let’s start in February and make our way through the months, shall we?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To begin, in February, our tiny house project took a bit of a breather, allowing us to indulge in some personal pursuits. Erny played some Frisbee, which offered a welcome break from the tiny house grind. Lys bought a new second hand road-bike and promptly caught COVID-19. Writing and reflecting on this now, it really does feel like an eon ago. Construction wise, we finished the diagonal portion of the outside wall and Evan gifted us some privacy vinyl for our windows.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
