&lt;p>Just kidding â€” but it &lt;em>has&lt;/em> started to feel that way with the electrics coming online this month and once again, we know it&amp;rsquo;s August, and last build update was in May but we&amp;rsquo;ve been really trying to make serious progress this build. We also know that we had a planned move in date for May&amp;hellip;and that did not happen obviously.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But why is the tiny house an appliance? Read on to find out ðŸ˜Š&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2025 January to May Build Update: Progress, Travel, and Tiny Wins</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2025-january-to-may-build-update/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 18:56:57 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2025-january-to-may-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh, heyyyy long time no see&amp;hellip;itâ€™s been a little while since weâ€™ve updated you all â€” five months, to be exact! Between travelling, working, and chipping away at the house, the blog has definitely fallen to the wayside, but weâ€™re back with plenty to share. Letâ€™s dive into whatâ€™s been keeping us busy over the past few months. &lt;strong>Spoiler alert&lt;/strong>: weâ€™ve made progress, but as usual our timeline has been blown out of the window.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>October, November and December Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2024-oct-nov-dec-build-update/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 17:33:10 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2024-oct-nov-dec-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>Happy 2025! We hope you&amp;rsquo;ve had a restful festive season ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ‰. Time doesnâ€™t just fly â€” it seems to sprint when youâ€™re building a tiny house. Going to pack updates for October, November, and December in this build update, thereâ€™s been a lot more construction than reflection and writing. But, as we reminisce on the past three months, itâ€™s clear how much weâ€™ve accomplished, as we continue to chip away at our goals. From plumbing adventures to detours into Passive House design and marathon plywood sessions, every moment has been filled with both sweat (thank you 34 Â°C degree days) and satisfaction (seeing the house fully closed up has been so cool!).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>June and July Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2024-june-july-build-update/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2024 18:20:37 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2024-june-july-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello! Itâ€™s another double month build update, not by design but by necessity as we have been working hard to make this tiny house more of a reality. June saw us work on our kitchen cabinets while we wait for the professionals and buying an HRV system, and July saw us getting all our insulation done! We watched many hours of Tour de France and as Lys writes this the Olympics is on in the background, so we are feeling very inspired watching others achieve their goals. Letâ€™s dive right in!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>February and March Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2024-feb-mar-build-update/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Apr 2024 14:51:27 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2024-feb-mar-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well hello there, long time no write. Not really sure where all the time went, but letâ€™s start in February and make our way through the months, shall we?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To begin, in February, our tiny house project took a bit of a breather, allowing us to indulge in some personal pursuits. Erny played some Frisbee, which offered a welcome break from the tiny house grind. Lys bought a new second hand road-bike and promptly caught COVID-19. Writing and reflecting on this now, it really does feel like an eon ago. Construction wise, we finished the diagonal portion of the outside wall and Evan gifted us some privacy vinyl for our windows.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
