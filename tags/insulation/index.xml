Here we meet and say farewell to August and September — as usual, time escapes us. One moment we were just getting into the rhythm of things, and the next, we were wrapped up in the chaos of the month with everything bleeding into September. Our friends got married, we went up north and we enjoyed concerts but perhaps the biggest distraction — and a speedy luxury — was the opening of the new Metro in our area! It’s a bit trivial, but it cuts the commute time by 50% and allows us to fit in more life into our days. Lys has been a bit of slack on the documenting of tiny house moments recently in the pursuit of finishing things, but August saw us finish our storage loft!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>June July Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2024-june-july-build-update/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2024 18:20:37 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2024-june-july-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello! It’s another double month build update, not by design but by necessity as we have been working hard to make this tiny house more of a reality. June saw us work on our kitchen cabinets while we wait for the professionals and buying an HRV system, and July saw us getting all our insulation done! We watched many hours of Tour de France and as Lys writes this the Olympics is on in the background, so we are feeling very inspired watching others achieve their goals. Let’s dive right in!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>February and March Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2024-feb-mar-build-update/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Apr 2024 14:51:27 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2024-feb-mar-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well hello there, long time no write. Not really sure where all the time went, but let’s start in February and make our way through the months, shall we?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To begin, in February, our tiny house project took a bit of a breather, allowing us to indulge in some personal pursuits. Erny played some Frisbee, which offered a welcome break from the tiny house grind. Lys bought a new second hand road-bike and promptly caught COVID-19. Writing and reflecting on this now, it really does feel like an eon ago. Construction wise, we finished the diagonal portion of the outside wall and Evan gifted us some privacy vinyl for our windows.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>May Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-may-build-update/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2023 11:08:26 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-may-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="an-may-build-update">An May build update&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Hello, hello! As May rolls on, the days are getting shorter, and our productivity has slowed down. Not to make this blog become a &lt;code>Let's complain about the weather&lt;/code> blog, but with the weather changing, we&amp;rsquo;ve had to battle with the elements to get any work done. Sunny weekdays are always followed by rainy weekends, leaving us only a few good hours to work on our project. To find a silver lining, we have become masters of water management though - devising a very high tech system of tarps and buckets to ensure minimal pooling.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
