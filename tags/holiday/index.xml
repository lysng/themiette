&lt;p>Just kidding — but it &lt;em>has&lt;/em> started to feel that way with the electrics coming online this month and once again, we know it&amp;rsquo;s August, and last build update was in May but we&amp;rsquo;ve been really trying to make serious progress this build. We also know that we had a planned move in date for May&amp;hellip;and that did not happen obviously.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But why is the tiny house an appliance? Read on to find out 😊&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2025 January to May Build Update: Progress, Travel, and Tiny Wins</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2025-january-to-may-build-update/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 18:56:57 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2025-january-to-may-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh, heyyyy long time no see&amp;hellip;it’s been a little while since we’ve updated you all — five months, to be exact!

Let’s dive into what’s been keeping us busy over the past few months. &lt;strong>Spoiler alert&lt;/strong>: we’ve made progress, but as usual our timeline has been blown out of the window.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>April and May Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2024-apr-may-build-update/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jul 2024 13:04:21 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2024-apr-may-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>My goodness hasn’t it been a time — feels like we haven’t written a post in a long time.

&lt;p>Hello and happy new year! We hope your break was filled with relaxation and joy. Ours was a mix of hard work and a few breakthroughs in our tiny house project. Let&amp;rsquo;s catch you up on our latest adventures.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Did anyone experience hail in your area? We were, once again, in a relentless race against daylight and unpredictable weather. The elements threw everything at us, from rain to scorching 40-degree days, and even a hail spell! Erny spent most of the break looking at the Weatherzone app to make sure we would always be in the clear. Even with these curveballs, over Christmas, our tiny house saw significant progress.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>November Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-nov-build-update/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Dec 2023 11:08:26 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-nov-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="a-november-build-update">A November build update&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Greetings from our ever-evolving construction site! November has been a month of highs, lows, and, of course, more cladding adventures. So, grab your virtual hard hat, and let&amp;rsquo;s dive into the nitty-gritty details.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Our journey begins with drumroll… putting finishing touches on a wall, and oh, what a journey it has been. The internal debate raged on: to cover the corner where cladding meets, should we go with Surfmist steel corner flashing or the charm of contrasting wood trim? In the end, the warmth of wood won us over, embracing its subtle curves and warps over time. We kicked things off by cutting and installing some Douglas fir corners. It might not be as durable as steel, but it looks undeniably great! These corners were definitely a challenge to install as we started using those beautiful yet painful brass screws. We bought these in June if you, dear reader, remember and now making they were grand debut.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>September October Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-sep-oct-build-update/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 11:08:26 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-sep-oct-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="a-september-holiday-and-an-october-build-update">A September holiday and an October build update&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>The past months have been a whirlwind of adventure, starting with a journey to the United States for a wedding - congratulations Visrut and Ruhani! We travelled from Australia to the U.S. and embarked on an adventure that took us from the vibrant streets of New Orleans all the way to the iconic city of New York. Along the way, we had the pleasure of exploring the stunning natural beauty of the Smoky Mountains National Park. Our hike along a small section of the Appalachian Trail was a definite highlight. A huge shout-out to Kat, Erny&amp;rsquo;s frisbee friend, for being our guide and teaching us about hemlock, spruce, and fir trees.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>August Build Update</title><link>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-aug-build-update/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Sep 2023 11:08:26 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://lysng.github.io/themiette/posts/2023-aug-build-update/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="an-august-build-update">An August build update&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re back with another exciting update from our construction escapades. August has been a whirlwind of challenges, cleaning, and mad dash purchases but we&amp;rsquo;ve managed to make some significant roofing progress on our tiny house. Buckle up, because we&amp;rsquo;ve got quite the adventure to share!&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="what-weve-done">What we&amp;rsquo;ve done&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>As we kicked off August, we found ourselves juggling two passions: our relentless dedication to our tiny house project (read as: desperation to finish the roof before we leave for the US) and the thrilling tension of the Women&amp;rsquo;s World Cup (go the Matildas!). Our multitasking skills were put to the test as we cheered for our favourite teams while meticulously measuring and constructing.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
