Working almost every weekend, these last two months we\u0026rsquo;ve actually got a proper build update 😄.\nTable Of Contents\rWhat we\u0026rsquo;ve done Highlights Challenges What\u0026rsquo;s next? What we\u0026rsquo;ve done We went through our stash of 90x45mm lengths and picked out roof rafters. These have been measured down to a 20 degree angle and some have been cut to size! We\u0026rsquo;ve been doing this in the garage when there has been a rain shower break and it has worked quite well. Erny created a little jig to speed up the process and it has been great get that out of the way.\nWorking in the garage cutting window rafters\nThen we spent 3 whole days stripping the faces of our cedar cladding boards. Originally, we were going to use paint stripper and scrape the old paint off but we found that method too slow. By shearing the face off the boards we can get to the beautiful grain quickly, but it does substantially decrease the thickness down from 19mm to 15mm, which is just enough to continue using the pieces as cladding. We still need to cut out to extend the tongue and grooves of each piece (there are about 70 3m pieces to fix up) but that\u0026rsquo;s a future problem. It is truly a labour of love refurbishing this cladding but we think it will be worth it! Western Red Cedar is often $30 - $40 per lineal meter as it is not grown in Australian plantations and so we are very lucky to have found some at no cost on the secondary market (good work Erny!).\nStripping western red cedar cladding\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve finally tweaked and re-tweaked our design for our custom windows. We are kind of following a process similar to Project Kamp - they made a comprehensive video about their window journey which you can watch below.\nLike Project Kamp, we are also using double glazed windows (see our post on our recent-ish trip to Canberra) but we are using Blackbutt frames. We also purchased EPDM414 self adhesive window tape from Clark Rubber to keep our windows water and air tight. Clark Rubber is this rubber and pool store in Australia that has a bright yellow platypus as its logo - Honestly Lys had never been to Clark Rubber before and it was just a random experience. Who knew that there were so many rubber products available to the retail market?\nThen our much awaited week of leave came around! We spent most of our week off machining these window frames down to size and cutting channels and beading. Honestly this was pretty slow going - measuring, cutting, re-measuring our mistakes but we are definitely closer to putting our glass into the frames.\nCutting window pieces to size\nFinished window pieces\nFeature Window (our biggest window) Pieces\nFinally, our finishing oil and putty came in the mail and Lys is excited to use some new products. We are going to protect our blackbutt frames with an product from Osmo - UV Protection Oil1. This stuff is literally the good oil - being easy to prepare, easy to apply and easy to maintain. It is also made of natural oils (sunflower oil, soya oil, thistle oil and linseed oil) and has lower amounts of volatile chemicals.\nThe only down side to this product is that we had to ship it from Queensland! It seems that there are no retailers in our state who stock this product at an affordable price\u0026hellip;\nHighlights We got another extension cord! This may not sound like much but we have been working on one singular powerpoint. Having another extension cord means that we can use (wait for it\u0026hellip;) a whopping two power tools at the same time. It\u0026rsquo;s the little things that bring joy you know?\nChallenges Our week off came with a few challenges! The few days prior Lys religiously checked the weather forecast every hour on the hour to see what our prospects were for full days of work. Luckily the forecast was more conservative than usual and we managed to get over 8 hours of work in per day.\nWe also had a few issues with our very faithful Makita table saw and tool set. We were making some cross cuts on the table saw and discovered that NOTHING was square. It turns out that the set square the we had been using was out by 1mm. This isn\u0026rsquo;t an issue when we are working on larger longer pieces (e.g cladding) but is a positive nightmare when it comes to woodworking that requires more finesse (cough the windows). To remediate, we set off for an emergency (and actually square) set square which made our lives a whole lot easier (and more accurate). We also discovered the benefits - and it sounds a little silly - to cleaning the table saw blade. We were experiencing inconvenient friction burn marks on our blackbutt wood and our friend Silvia suggested that it may be time for a new blade or a quick clean. Taking pause to maintain our tools reduced the friction burn marks and allowed us to eek a few more cuts out of the old blade.\nGot somewhat distracted by all the Makita products\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next? Australia\u0026rsquo;s Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) has officially confirmed that we are heading into yet another La Niña, our 3rd consecutive wet Summer so honestly not feeling very hopeful. But slow progress is still progress so that is something.\nI am not crying about the rain are crying about the rain\nCatch ya later, Lys \u0026amp; Erny\nRead the technical specs of Osmo here\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","href":"/themiette/posts/aug-sep-2022-build-update/","title":"August September 2022 Build Update"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/build_update/","title":"build_update"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/cedar/","title":"cedar"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/cladding/","title":"cladding"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/posts/","title":"Posts"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/tiny_house/","title":"tiny_house"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/windows/","title":"windows"},{"content":"Operation Find a Roof As Lys sits down to write this she can officially say that we have sourced all of our roof components! It is a mixture of second hand material and some first-hand non-negotiable(s) but it\u0026rsquo;s great to finally have all the bits and bobs.\nTable Of Contents\rThe Design The Material Gutters Sundry Items The Design We chose to have a slightly off centred gable roof for our tiny house. Technically this is known as a saltbox pitch style but we have not found that term used commonly in Australia. We wanted to keep the traditional house style compared to some of the more modern tiny house options. The style is also quite useful for maximising solar panels on a small space and this will be helpful if we decide to go off-grid. It is also simple to construct as there are minimal valleys or curves which makes it great for novice builders also known as cough us.\nOur roof design\nWe are going to have a roof pitch of 20 degrees (which is standard for most houses and easier to find second hand materials for) even though we could have as little as a 5 degree roof pitch for a gable roof. Most tiny houses choose a shed style or flat roof which is technically more space economical as one can get more internal head height but we really liked the more traditional aesthetic. There is just something so comfortable and cosy about a gable roof.\nGable, Saltbox, Flat and Shed roof styles are all common tiny house options\nThe Material Metal was our go to choice for a roof - it\u0026rsquo;s light, relatively affordable and easy to come by on the second hand market. Often larger jobs will order 10% extra as leeway and sell the remainder. We actually found our Colorbond from a lovely family fixing a shed, a elderly couple redoing a carport and a renovation on the Central Coast.\nOn our way up from the Central Coast we had this brilliant idea to cut the Colorbond panelling with tin snips to fit the sheets into the van. It turns out that it is incredibly difficult to cut corrugated iron with tin snips (think of these like scissors for metal) over long distances and most people just use a circular saw or angle grinder. Luckily we had a rope that Erny was given from another pick up and we bundled 6m pieces of Colorbond into the back of the van and tied the boot closed for a 1.5hr drive home. Note to self - always bring a circular saw!\nBut what about the colour?\nLys absolutely adores a dark coloured and black roof. It is the current tiny house trend at the moment and looks very sleek, blending into the the environment if it is particularly verdant. The building industry also loves a good dark roof as well1.\nThat being said - the colour is not the ideal colour in sunny Australia, or anywhere warm in this changing climate2. Long story short - dark coloured surfaces absorb more heat energy than lighter colours. In a roofing context this heats the roof cavity of your home and - unless you have great insulation - heats the interior of your home. On a broader scale, with urban sprawl suburbs can fall victim to the Urban Heat Island3 effect - where urban centers are significantly warmer than rural areas due to having less trees and more dark surfaces.\nAt one point in time Australian states were looking to ban dark coloured roofs on new developments.\nHaving said this - a tiny house roof is very small so in the grand scheme of things it probably won\u0026rsquo;t matter, but as Australia\u0026rsquo;s cities experience more urban sprawl it is more important than ever to make small steps to heat-proof abodes - and this means Lys must sacrifice her dark coloured roof.\nSo we are going with Surf Mist as our roof colour! Solar Absorptance (SA) is the proportion of the total incident solar radiation that is absorbed by the roofing material (the remainder is reflected) and a roof with a lower solar absorptance will absorb less heat than a roof with a higher solar absorptance. Theoretically, this should keep the roof space and building cooler on a hot day.\nSurfmist has a SA of 0.32 - compared to Monument (an incredibly popular tiny house roof colour) which has a SA of 0.71. Obviously if we had our time again we\u0026rsquo;d love to use Whitehaven or Dover White (SA of 0.23) but it seems like it is not available for retail consumers, rather it is an architectural offering only.\nClassic Colorbond Colours\nGutters We found the gutters in the Haberfield of all places. A heritage listed house had accidentally ordered the incorrect gutter type in the colour that we were looking for (Surfmist) and we pounced. We ended up getting them for free as well 😄 We actually ended up using the same rope to secure our gutters in the van - we suppose the real take away here is always bring a rope when picking up second hand construction items.\nTaking off gutters\nSundry Items It was most difficult trying to find flashing, ridge caps and rivets second hand. We ended up purchasing on the first-hand market (and rust is a thing so we thought this would be the best approach). This posed another problem as most suppliers are not interested in servicing such a small job or they are a full service fit out (i.e. they provide the product and the installation service). Other vendors wouldn\u0026rsquo;t match the existing gutters that we had or were not based in our state - shipping costs are a killer! Additionally, with rising construction costs website prices were inflated from 5% - 20% on the personalized quote.\nLuckily we found Jack from Roofit Online which had an online store (because as we know Millennials avoid talking on the phone like the plague) and 24/7 customer service. They specialise in Colorbond and locally manufacture. What they can\u0026rsquo;t make they source though their team based in NSW as well.They also take all types of jobs no matter how small which is great when building a tiny house. Jack was super patient and chucked a 5% discount - thanks Jack! We only have good things to say.\nSo here we are - one nerdy rant later about roof colours and we are a little bit closer to putting ours up!\nCatch ya later, Lys \u0026amp; Erny\nFind out why people like dark roofs with Renew\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nIf you feel extra nerdy Lys found this paper on roof performance around the world a great read\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nUrban Heat Island Effect is a term used to describe the outer suburbs of major cities with minimal tree cover.

We had been on the hunt for double glazed glass closer to home but it seems that Canberra - having cold winters - has great reclaimed glass options.\nTable Of Contents\rIntroducing Handyman Trading Post A side step antiquing So what\u0026rsquo;d you get? But why use double glazing?\nWeight is a huge issue in tiny house construction (we need to keep the building under 4.5 tonnes) and double glazed glass is notoriously heavy. This is fine for a traditional build but for tiny house construction builders often choose to install single paned glass. We chose double paned glass because firstly, Erny wanted this feature, but also because our windows will take a good percentage of our wall surface area. We\u0026rsquo;re also trying out a continuous band of insulation on top of insulation batting to reduce thermal bridging in light of Passive House design so it would be a pity to have insulated walls but have all our heat leak out of our windows. We\u0026rsquo;re also not planning on adding active heating mechanisms (e.g air-con) to the Miette if we have to so choosing double glazed windows seems like a good way to go for now.\nIntroducing Handyman Trading Post Handymans Trading Post specialises in used building materials and seems to be the only place that sells double glazed glass on the east coast. Erny found them on Facebook Marketplace and they were super friendly online. They recommended that we pop down in person to see their panes and even though they were in another state the trip was well worth it.\nThe Handyman Trading Post\nWindows everywhere!\nWhen we went in January, they had some great stock (which is what you get from over 41 years in business). They seem to have Australia\u0026rsquo;s collection cedar doors and window frames and some of the nicest stained glass windows too. You can find more about Handyman Trading Post here.\nCanberra has the best stock\nNote: they close at 1PM on Saturdays so if you are traveling from afar, factor this in! We arrived at 12:30 - just in time to pick up our glass.\nA side step antiquing There\u0026rsquo;s also a cute antique store named Down Memory Lane which is just opposite so we spent some time there checking out the wares. The stock seems so much cheaper than up North and the furniture was in top quality. Definitely recommend a looksee.\nCanberra has the best stock\nSo what\u0026rsquo;d you get? So after months of looking we have our double glazed glass for our custom windows!\nOur picture window is a generous 1400 x 1100mm and will be our main feature. It\u0026rsquo;s currently residing in Lys\u0026rsquo; office covered by a towel. Our kitchen window pane is a little larger than we anticipated coming in at (470x1200mm). We\u0026rsquo;ll have to manipulate our walls to fit this window into our design. We lucked out with our bathroom window as there was only a small selection of frosted glass options but we came away with a thin long window which we should be able to put frosted film on.\nFinally, we were super lucky to get two panes exactly the same dimensions for our loft windows (at 300x900mm)!\nCatch ya later, Lys \u0026amp; Erny\nArrive early if you\u0026rsquo;re traveling far\n","href":"/themiette/posts/a-quick-trip-to-canberra/","title":"A Quick Trip to Canberra"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/canberra/","title":"canberra"},{"content":"\rTable Of Contents\rResearching Introducing Hauslien Other reputable trailer manufacturers Challenges What\u0026rsquo;s next? A Foundation One of the biggest purchases we made for this build was the trailer. As the foundation of our house it was something that we didn\u0026rsquo;t really want to make ourselves (there was a hard stop at learning how to weld). We also wanted the trailer to be road worthy so thought it would be best to leave this to the professionals.\nResearching When you first start researching about tiny houses one definitely gets lured in with titles like \u0026ldquo;She Built a Beautiful TINY HOUSE for only $12,384!\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Jay Shafer\u0026rsquo;s Stunning $5,000 Tiny House\u0026rdquo; (these may or may not be real tiny house videos on YouTube).

We\u0026rsquo;re hoping to reach lock up by then (walls, floor and roof complete) and 31st December is our D-day.\nTable Of Contents\rWhat we\u0026rsquo;ve done Challenges What\u0026rsquo;s next? What we\u0026rsquo;ve done Erny bought a second hand table saw for $400 a few months back and it\u0026rsquo;s been an absolute workhorse. With it we\u0026rsquo;ve milled our wood down to size (70x45mm) for our walls and have started cutting down the blackbutt for our window frames.\nWorking with a job site table (one that\u0026rsquo;s portable) saw has meant there have been a few tweaks that we\u0026rsquo;ve had to make. The first is that the vibrations and when one rips though a particularly long length of wood the fence is prone to shifting. Erny hacked a wood piece to clamp on to the table saw to minimise this.\nMilling douglas fir to size\nAnother is that the vibrations move the table saw forward on the table that we\u0026rsquo;re using. Once again clamps come to our rescue as we decided to clamp down two pieces of wood to the end of the table. These act as a stopper to stop the table saw shifting.\nCutting blackbutt to size\nSomething else that we\u0026rsquo;ve noticed is how good douglas fir smells. Apparently it smells like citrus but it just smells really fragrant. And as a soft wood it\u0026rsquo;s super light! Douglas fir is considered one of the most resilient softwoods in the commercial market and can handle really hard conditions. You\u0026rsquo;ll find it in older style houses or in large beams. Apparently, it was the go-to wood in the 19th century and was milled in all over Sydney. Now, apparently, Australia goes for treated pine for its lumber material as its quicker to grow and Douglas fir is less available. Our lumber comes from a timber mill that was closing down to make way for apartments and off cuts from a housing renovation.\nBlackbutt is our wood of choice to frame our windows with Erny having the bright idea to make the window frames himself. It\u0026rsquo;s a ridiculously heavy native hardwood that has a gorgeous grain and colour. We picked up the planks at an auction house to save them from getting mulched as they have quite a few cracks and burls in them (or as some people like to say - character). It also smells different to the Douglas fir when it gets sawn - because it\u0026rsquo;s a hardwood. Since Blackbutt is so dense it causes the blade to heat up due to increased friction. This burns the wood and brings out a more burnt smell.\nWood Density Notes Douglas Fir 550kg/m3 Softwood Blackbutt 900kg/m3 Hardwood Also, we\u0026rsquo;re following part of the Unified Construction Method by Fred Schultz, by creating ply connectors for our roof rafters and have measured 23 of these out. Lys had to hunt high and low for a protractor that hadn\u0026rsquo;t been touched since Year 6 Maths.\nChallenges We\u0026rsquo;ve had a string of pretty good weekends in June so can\u0026rsquo;t complain about the weather! ☀️🌧️ A thing we\u0026rsquo;re trying to tweak at the moment is finding fastest and most optimal way to set up our workspace since we\u0026rsquo;re working outside. Currently we\u0026rsquo;re putting out two fold out tables and using some spare agriculture pipe to manage particles.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next? Erny\u0026rsquo;s flying out to the US for most of July and the forecast is looking pretty awful so it\u0026rsquo;s unlikely that we\u0026rsquo;ll be getting much done this month.
