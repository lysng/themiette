Between travelling, working, and chipping away at the house, the blog has definitely fallen to the wayside, but we‚Äôre back with plenty to share. Let‚Äôs dive into what‚Äôs been keeping us busy over the past few months. Spoiler alert: we‚Äôve made progress, but as usual our timeline has been blown out of the window.\nTable Of Contents\rJanuary: Plywood Dreams and the First Cup of Tea February: Painting, Wombats, and a Wedding March: Solo Leveling and Staircase Prep April: Shower Pans and Tile Troubles May: Tiling Triumphs and Late-Night Projects Looking Ahead January: Plywood Dreams and the First Cup of Tea January was all about transformations. A new year‚Ä¶a new plan to finish the tiny house‚Ä¶and new plywood installs? We finished installing the plywood lining on the walls and now, suddenly, the tiny house has begun to look like an actual home. Watching it all come together felt like one of those moments where the endless hours of planning and cutting pieces by hand (mostly by Erny, sometimes Lys just stands there) finally paid off.\nWe‚Äôve started adding small touches to bring warmth and personality into the space. One of our favourite additions is a beautiful artwork made by Erny‚Äôs niece ‚Äî it‚Äôs now sitting proudly in the loft of the house, reminding us to finish as quickly as possible so we can hang it on a wall properly.\nCutting plywood for wall lining\nOur collection of decoration to be hung eventually\nThe bathroom then became the month‚Äôs primary focus. We installed the plywood backing and created a service cavity for all the essential plumbing and electrical cables. Next came the tile backing board, which was surprisingly fun to work with. We overlaid this over our plywood foundation.\nHonestly, we haven‚Äôt seen much information about tiny house builders using tile backer board (maybe because tiles aren‚Äôt the done thing to install as they are quite heavy) but for us, it was an easy choice. It‚Äôs lightweight, which made handling and installation much simpler in such a small space. Beyond that, it‚Äôs highly moisture-resistant, which is obviously an essential feature for wet areas like the shower. We also loved how easy it was to cut (just with a Stanley knife!), saving us time and effort compared to heavier, more cumbersome materials. Its squishy foam core is also so satisfying to cut through, which is an added sensory bonus. Lys‚Äô friend Tina came over for tea which was so nice, and while the space is far from finished, there‚Äôs something special about sharing it with others, even in its raw state.\nInstalling the tile backing board\nFebruary: Painting, Wombats, and a Wedding February kicked off with more bathroom progress ‚Äî specifically, waterproofing. The waterproofing membrane turned the walls and ceiling a vibrant green, adding a pop of unexpected colour to the space. Lys really enjoyed this part, much to Erny‚Äôs confusion.\nWith the waterproofing complete, we escaped for a bit of adventure. Originally, we had planned to hike the Overland Track in Tasmania, but wildfires forced us to pivot to the East Coast instead. The East Coast was stunning ‚Äî pristine empty beaches, lush greenery, and wildlife everywhere. We spotted wombats waddling through the bush, saw Tasmanian devils on Maria Island (which we have been informed it to be pronounced as Mar-rai-a by the locals), and ate our weight in scallop pies and oysters. Lys even brought back a family pie from Jackson and McRoss all the way from Hobart. If that wasn‚Äôt enough escapism, from there, we hopped over to Phuket for the wedding of the decade. Jess and Maxime tied the knot in a celebration that brought our climbing crew together in one of the most beautiful settings imaginable. Congratulations to the happy couple!\nHiking in Tasmania on Wineglass Bay\nIs it starting to become clear why our April move in date is a little ambitious?\nMarch: Solo Leveling and Staircase Prep March was a quieter month, at least for Lys. She spent most of it in the US for work (not something on her bingo card for 2025), which left Erny to hold down the fort at home. Progress slid to a halt. In hindsight, it‚Äôs not very motivating when there‚Äôs one person on the job site when it is a two-person project.\nOne of the biggest projects Erny tackled was preparing for the staircase installation. It‚Äôs one of those steps (pun intended) that feels pivotal to making the house truly live-able. Erny also did some general prepping and tidying that set the stage for the months ahead.\nApril: Shower Pans and Tile Troubles Easter is usually a big building break for us, but this year, life got in the way. Work schedules and other commitments made it impossible to take our usual build-a-thon, which was a little disheartening. As previously highlighted, we had hoped to finish the house by the end of April or early May, but that timeline started to feel less and less realistic. With Lys‚Äô return, Erny tackled the shower pan using a flush diamond blade. It was nerve-wracking (power tools + precision = mega stress), but the result was surprisingly good.\nCutting the shower base for a flush tile over\nErny in action with the diamond flush blade\nThen came the tile saga. We had a stash of free tiles salvaged from a house renovation in Bondi, but identifying what they were made of turned into a full-blown investigation. Were they ceramic? Cement? Porcelain? After some Googling, taste-testing (yes, that‚Äôs apparently a thing if your tiles taste like soap they‚Äôre cement), and digging through the Wayback Machine, we confirmed they were in fact porcelain. We may have wasted a weekend over this, but it is always better to be safe than sorry. Crisis averted!\nThe next step was choosing a layout. We enlisted our friends for input, and the consensus landed on a picnic rug pattern. Not to toot our horns but it‚Äôs really cute!\nWhich one do you like better?\nMay: Tiling Triumphs and Late-Night Projects May has been all about the bathroom floor ‚Äî and what a project it‚Äôs been! We started by buying a second-hand tile cutter off Facebook Marketplace. It‚Äôs hilariously oversized for our needs, being able to cut huge 95 cm tiles, but it got the job done on our tiny 20 cm tiles (f anyone wants to borrow a massive tile cutter, let us know!).\nThen, laying out the tiles and cutting them to size took patience and precision. Tiling is physically demanding work, even in a small space like ours. While Lys buttered the back of every single tile, Erny‚Äôs perfectionism ensured every tile was flush and level. Watching the floor come together was deeply satisfying. Our backs and knees were crying days after.\nStirring up tile adhesive\nTiling late into the evening\nOne Friday night, we found ourselves working until midnight, meticulously silicone-ing all the edges in prep for the next day. Here, blue painter‚Äôs tape was our secret weapon for getting crisp, clean lines. With the tiles in place, we moved on to grouting. Neither of us had grouted before, but luckily Bunnings YouTube came in clutch with their three part series: How to mix grout, How to grout tiles and How to seal grout. Honestly, YouTube is the best place to mine for information and Bunnings YouTube is S tier. They step through every single part in simple language and make you feel DIY invincible.\nIt soon became clear that we could not do this job without a mythical grout float. Its hard foam base made pushing the grout into corners and gaps much easier than we anticipated. The end result? A fully finished bathroom floor that looks and feels like a professional installation. Lys‚Äô dad even called it a ‚Äúfeature floor,‚Äù and we couldn‚Äôt be happier with how it turned out.\nOne of the unsung heroes of May has been our new Makita battery-powered light. It‚Äôs made late-night projects so much easier (and quieter), allowing us to work well into the evening without running power cords. Thanks Erny for the find!\nLooking Ahead With half of May still ahead, our focus is on finishing the bathroom and tackling the kitchen ceiling. Completing the bathroom will be a huge achievement ‚Äî one room will be finally complete!\nOur original goal was to finish the tiny house by the end of April, with a move in May. While that timeline has shifted, slowly yet surely, we‚Äôre still making steady progress.

We hope you\u0026rsquo;ve had a restful festive season üéÑüéâ. Time doesn‚Äôt just fly ‚Äî it seems to sprint when you‚Äôre building a tiny house. Going to pack updates for October, November, and December in this build update, there‚Äôs been a lot more construction than reflection and writing. But, as we reminisce on the past three months, it‚Äôs clear how much we‚Äôve accomplished, as we continue to chip away at our goals. From plumbing adventures to detours into Passive House design and marathon plywood sessions, every moment has been filled with both sweat (thank you 34 ¬∞C degree days) and satisfaction (seeing the house fully closed up has been so cool!).\nTable Of Contents\rPlumbing Passive House Plywood Angles Plumbing October started with a visit from Warren, our plumber extraordinaire. Warren isn‚Äôt just any plumber ‚Äî he‚Äôs an encyclopedic wealth of plumbing knowledge who loves a good yarn over a strong cup of tea. He spent half a day with us, not just helping with the plumbing but explaining the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind every decision and helping us design our plumbing schema. Then, together, over the next fortnight, he walked us through installing all of our rough in plumbing. We glued down the bathroom tile tray, installed PEX pipes for hot and cold water, and drilled through the subfloor for the plumbing outlets. Warren even advised us to use red PEX for hot water and black for cold ‚Äî a small but clever way to keep things organised. We learnt how the behind the scenes of rough in plumbing for the shower, sink, and laundry, shifting our perspective on pipe placement and future-proofing our design should we look to add more complex features. A nugget of gold was Warren telling us why he hates installing kitchen taps with extendable hoses as they are prone to more leaks. Secretly Erny wanted to install one of these but we kept quiet this time round üòÇ. Another nugget was Warren questioning why we needed two sinks (one in the bathroom and one in the kitchen) considering we have such a small space. He wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure that we would find an appropriate off the shelf small sink and that we would most likely need to design or make a custom bathroom sink option to do justice to the small space. With this in mind, we changed our design last minute (reducing cost for us!). Warren took the time to teach us novices instead of rushing to finish the job, so now we feel more confident knowing where all our pipes are going. We were so appreciative to work alongside someone so experienced, and we came away feeling much more confident in our approach.\nPlumbing with Warren\nRed and black pex pipes for the washing machine\nLearning the tools of the trade for a day\nLater in October, we had the chance to borrow a track saw from the tool library, and what a revelation that was. Compared to our DIY circular saw setup, the track saw cut like a dream ‚Äî straight, clean lines with none of the frustration we‚Äôd grown used to. Some may say that our old set up wasn‚Äôt really‚Ä¶cutting it (haha). It was perfect timing, too, as we were tackling some intricate internal cladding cuts on plywood. These needed to fit together seamlessly on our uneven walls to reduce the number of visible screws and lines, so the precision of the track saw was invaluable. It‚Äôs now firmly on our wish list.\nPassive House We also welcomed a slight change of pace when we attended a free Passive House tour hosted by Envirotecture. Passive House is a framework that is becoming more common in Australia and is focused on creating buildings that are energy efficient yet comfortable. Seeing a professionally designed Passive House up close was incredibly inspiring ‚Äî a world away from volume building that we are used to and very different compared to when you watch Grand Designs on TV! Features like double-glazed windows, cross-laminated timber, HRV systems, and vapour barriers were all on display, and it was exciting to see how our own build mirrored some of these principles. It would have been nice to have taken the tour before we started construction, but it was nice to know with our new-found knowledge we could actually understand what the builder and architects were talking about ‚Äî all that jargon actually sticking in our heads instead of in one ear and out the other. The tour reinforced that building for energy efficiency and comfort isn‚Äôt just a niche in the Australian building landscape ‚Äî it‚Äôs a movement gaining traction. We would definitely go on another tour, and visiting the house re-invigorated our building zeal. As an aside, you can check out Envirotecture here: https://www.envirotecture.com.au/.\nPassive House framing\nBirds eye view of all the layers of insulation and the service cavity\nPlywood Angles November brought more challenges, particularly with angles. We returned to the tiny house, turning our focus to the finicky task of cladding the inside of the skylights and tackling the ceiling. The heavy plywood sheets were a challenge, requiring ladders, a makeshift contraption to hold them in place, and plenty of patience. During these weekends, there were no OH\u0026amp;S protocols on the build site. The heavy 9 mm plywood was a struggle to keep aligned 4 meters up in the air, and just seemed to slip and slide all over the place. There were some times when our forearms were burning in pain as we tried to install these pieces. Progress was slow, but since each sheet covered a large portion of the space, quickly, the house began to feel more and more complete. Then, Lys took a brief break to visit Japan, leaving Erny to his own devices. Not one to waste time, he bought a battery-powered circular saw and built a custom guide to mimic the track saw experience. By the time Lys returned, it was clear the new setup was a game-changer for cutting those straight lines. It couldn‚Äôt have come at a better time because soon we moved on to cutting different shapes with more obscure angles.\nSlow going on the ceiling\nFraming out the skylights with plywood\nAs November rolled into December, we hit a stride with two uninterrupted weeks over the Christmas and New Year\u0026rsquo;s break. Summer brought sweltering days with temperatures reaching 37 ¬∞C, but the long daylight hours allowed us to work from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., making it one of our most productive stretches yet. We finished the ceiling, opened up the second skylight, and turned our attention to the triangular sides of the loft. Note to self ‚Äî five-sided shapes are deceptively tricky, and each cut required a mix of precision and trial-and-error. Lys has never heard Erny swear so much over the course of a fortnight.\nWorking late into the night\nInstalling the final piece\nThe bathroom became our focus for the latter part of our holiday. Erny installed the ceiling using 7 mm plywood ‚Äî a tricky job not just because of the angles, but because we had to wrestle the plywood through the tiny bathroom door. Luckily, there was a bit of flex in the plywood, and so we angled the side in before twisting the piece through. Working in such tight quarters was a test of agility, and we were grateful for our slim builds as we squeezed into corners to hold the pieces in place. Progress on the shower walls followed, and we are planning on using a combination tile backing board and plywood in the shower stall for a combination of strength and lightness. The work was gruelling with shoulder strains and knee pain on both bodies but seeing the bathroom take shape has been a highlight.\nBathroom plumbing\nGetting set to waterproof the bathroom\nLooking back, we set some ambitious goals for the end of the year: finishing the plywood walls by the end of December and having the bathroom waterproof-ready by January 6th. While we didn‚Äôt quite hit those targets, the progress we made was immense. As we look ahead to March 31st ‚Äî our new goal for move-in day ‚Äî we‚Äôre feeling tentatively optimistic (emphasis on the word tentative). The house is evolving with every cut, every screw, and every cladded wall. As usual a huge thank you to our friends and family who have been supporting us in 2024 - we love you all lots ‚ù§Ô∏è. There‚Äôs still plenty to do, so here‚Äôs to a productive and transformative start to 2025!\nCatch ya later, Lys \u0026amp; Erny\nP.S As an aside, this post\u0026rsquo;s table of contents headers all start with P which is rather plosive.\nStarting to look like a cosy cabin\n","href":"/themiette/posts/2024-oct-nov-dec-build-update/","title":"October, November and December Build Update"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/plumbing/","title":"plumbing"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/tools/","title":"tools"},{"content":"Hello with another build update. Here we meet and say farewell to August and September ‚Äî as usual, time escapes us. One moment we were just getting into the rhythm of things, and the next, we were wrapped up in the chaos of the month with everything bleeding into September. Our friends got married, we went up north and we enjoyed concerts but perhaps the biggest distraction ‚Äî and a speedy luxury ‚Äî was the opening of the new Metro in our area! It‚Äôs a bit trivial, but it cuts the commute time by 50% and allows us to fit in more life into our days. Lys has been a bit of slack on the documenting of tiny house moments recently in the pursuit of finishing things, but August saw us finish our storage loft!\nTable Of Contents\rThe Storage Loft Internal Wall Cladding The Storage Loft Before making the storage loft we had the bright idea to put a vapour barrier in between our internal cladding and our insulation. The idea here is to protect the insulation from getting wet as much as possible and controlling vapour moving through the walls. We decided to use some Ametalin 1500mm x 30m SilverSark as it\u0026rsquo;s affordable. It was weird covering up all the insulation and all of the electrical. The whole house now looks the insides of a blue whale üêã.\nThe insides of a blue whale\nFor the storage loft to end all storage lofts, we used the last of our good Douglas fir and the remnants of our blackbutt floorboards. It felt bittersweet in a way, using the final pieces of wood that have been such a big part of the build. Even though we‚Äôre running low on high-quality wood, Erny is always very proud that we aren‚Äôt letting any of it go to waste. Compared to the sleeping loft and the floorboards, the storage loft was installed very quickly ‚Äî in just a day. It has already proved itself to be a very practical area as well ‚Äî now we store our extra insulation and lightweight material off the ground and having these bulky items out of the way has allowed us to bring more items in‚Ä¶üòÖJokes aside, the new loft is helping us keep the main living area clear for the remaining construction work.\nSetting up the frame\nStorage loft working overtime now!\nInternal Wall Cladding September began with a much-needed break from building as we headed to Brisbane to watch the Ultimate Frisbee Championships. After weeks of being hunched over tools and in front of the computer at work, it felt great to watch the games and enjoy the high-energy atmosphere of high level competitive sport. Team USA totally crushed the tournament, taking a clean sweep in all divisions, but it was great to see our Australian teams (Firetails and Dingoes) snag third place in both the women‚Äôs and open divisions. Huge congratulations to Rosa ‚Äî who was playing on the Firetails!\nOne of the first things we did after returning was to fill the air gaps around the windows. We used White Gap Filler Rod and insulation ‚Äî a trick we picked up from Scott Brown‚Äôs carpentry videos.\nMagic foam that solves all problems\nIt\u0026rsquo;s super satisfying putting the foam in the gaps and making everything weatherproof. As an aside, we have really been appreciating Scott\u0026rsquo;s videos and if you are in the mood for some relatable renovation comedy his video on an unfinished house is both depressing and hilarious!\nThen onto the task that will no doubt take the longest - we started installing the plywood to clad our internal walls. This was and has been an extremely slow process, and we found ourselves making little progress weekend after weekend. It\u0026rsquo;s just really fiddly work - one needs to measure the piece to size, nothing is square so we need to cut custom angles and dimensions, we need to cut out holes perfectly to fit cables etc. etc.\nCutting custom wall pieces out of the plywood wall\nNothing (and we mean nothing) is quite level, which means every piece of plywood has to be hand-cut to fit. It‚Äôs a slow, meticulous process, but Lys has been getting better and better at using the circular saw. The cuts are cleaner, quicker, and more precise with each new piece.\nEven disregarding the practical challenges, we are starting to make cosmetic compromises along the way, which has made the progress feel both frustrating and freeing. In typical ‚ÄúGrand Designs‚Äù fashion, we have hit the part where it feels like we‚Äôre running out of time, and while we haven‚Äôt run out of money (yet!), the pressure to finish is real (though self-inflicted). Lys is waiting for Kevin McCloud to pop out from around the corner with a zingy one-liner. One of the compromises that we have laboured over is using visible screws to install the plywood. It‚Äôs not the most polished look, but it‚Äôs a compromise we can live with for now. As Lys‚Äô friend Hugh said, it gives the place a ‚ÄúScandinavian industrial chic‚Äù vibe, and we‚Äôve decided to roll with that. Plus, it has its own kind of charm, and maybe in time, we‚Äôll come to love the exposed screws.\nKevin McCloud being all round disappointed about being over budget and out of time\nAs September progressed, we found ourselves in the ever familiar battle with the weather. It seems to be heating up quite a bit and on days like these we politely call the tiny house the Hot Box. On the bright side, the skylights have been a lifesaver. Not only do they let in a ton of natural light, but they‚Äôve also provided much-needed airflow on the days when the weather does cooperate. The space heats up quickly, so having those skylights open makes a world of difference. One final thing that we promise to do but never do is more filming and writing! Honestly, it‚Äôs hard to keep track of documenting the process when we are so focused on just getting things done. We know it‚Äôs good to reflect, but actually doing the work brings us closer to completion, so it‚Äôs a fine balance.\nLooking ahead, we‚Äôre racing against the clock (see our Grand Designs crisis from above). We‚Äôve crunched the numbers and, if everything goes according to plan, we‚Äôve got about 30 full working days left to bring this tiny house to fruition by the end of the year. It‚Äôs a daunting task, but not impossible. There‚Äôs still the matter of engaging a plumber, which has been hanging over our heads for a while now. It‚Äôs one of those things we keep pushing back, but we know we need to get it sorted soon. For now, though, we‚Äôre celebrating the small wins. We‚Äôve finished insulating the walls and ceiling, the wiring is in place, and the house is starting to feel more like a home with every passing day. With any luck ‚Äî and a bit of persistence ‚Äî we‚Äôll cross the finish line by December (and that‚Äôs what we say every year).\nInternal walls coming up a treat\nCatch ya later, Lys \u0026amp; Erny\n","href":"/themiette/posts/2024-aug-sep-build-update/","title":"August and September Build Update"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/cladding/","title":"cladding"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/grand_designs/","title":"grand_designs"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/insulation/","title":"insulation"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/loft/","title":"loft"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/storage/","title":"storage"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/electrical/","title":"electrical"},{"content":"Hello! It‚Äôs another double month build update, not by design but by necessity as we have been working hard to make this tiny house more of a reality. June saw us work on our kitchen cabinets while we wait for the professionals and buying an HRV system, and July saw us getting all our insulation done! We watched many hours of Tour de France and as Lys writes this the Olympics is on in the background, so we are feeling very inspired watching others achieve their goals. Let‚Äôs dive right in!\nTable Of Contents\rJune: Diving, Riding and Cutting Back into the Build July: Electrification! (Sort of) June: Diving, Riding and Cutting Back into the Build June went by in a blur to be frank, almost as if we had just stepped off the plane from Indonesia and immediately jumped back into our tiny house project. The month was largely dedicated to designing and constructing our kitchen cabinets, which as always is a lot harder than it looks. There is good reason why kitchen renovations are expensive, top quality finishes are hard to achieve without practice and patience. Even an IKEA kitchen is over $2000!\nWe found ourselves watching countless YouTube videos to grasp the finer points of cabinetry. Specifically, we also drew inspiration from Scott Brown Carpentry‚Äôs plywood kitchen video (which you can watch below).\nOur kitchen is unlikely to look as nice as his (for one, he is not looking to minimise weight at every turn) but it is wonderful inspiration. We have found overall, it\u0026rsquo;s an intricate process, requiring a whole new level of detail, very different to building the frame and the like. If building is the broad brush strokes of the canvas, then building cabinets is the final detail work, with the small brush. One of the challenges we faced was how easily plywood scratches. Drop something on it ‚Äî it scratches, Lean on it ‚Äî it scratches. Look at it ‚Äî it scratches. Unfinished plywood is such a stressful material to work with.\nSome positive things though, Lys became more adept with the circular saw cutting the plywood to more manageable pieces, and Erny had the bright idea to make a fence to speed up our long cuts. There was something immensely satisfying about cutting down those large plywood sheets into neatly squared pieces.\nCutting plywood down to size\nWe then started with the sink base cabinets, taking care to ensure everything was perfectly aligned. We are doing some funky work with the table saw, cutting notches into the sides of our cabinets for the bracing pieces. Hopefully it will work ‚Äî we are still not 100% sure. Next, we moved on to the stove base cabinets. Each step was a learning experience, we have changed the design a little for these to be more robust. It has been a journey, from understanding the structural requirements to the aesthetic considerations of upper kitchen cabinets. Finally, we designed and cut out the upper kitchen cabinets, as well as an alcove for the fridge.\nCutting notches on the table saw for bracing pieces\nJuly: Electrification! (Sort of) July brought with it the expertise of our sparkie, James, who came over on a fine weekend to lay out all the wiring. Watching a professional at work was a revelation; he moved with more speed than the two of us combined. It\u0026rsquo;s surprising how quickly things can get done when you know what you\u0026rsquo;re doing. Working with a professional challenged us to make concrete decisions. When it is just Erny and Lys, decisions can be flexible, changed and re-moulded to suit us as we learn. With someone who is contracted to complete a set piece of work, the ideas need to be defined, parameters set, definition of done understood by all parties. This is a pretty big shift in workings style for us, and we are still learning üòÑ. While James worked, Erny took the time to trace all the circuits, ensuring we knew exactly what was connected where. This step was crucial, especially as we prepared to cover the walls with insulation and internal house wrap.\nJames putting in our cabling for the lights\nEver the professional, he brings his own ladder even though we have three\nHi James!\nJames\u0026rsquo;s efficiency meant that we could start insulating the walls sooner than expected. Using the same glass wool insulation as in the floor, we tackled the task with all our PPE gear on to avoid the scratchiness and fine particles in the air. Initially, we had planned to host an insulation party with friends, but we quickly realised that too many people in a tiny house made the space feel cramped. So, we decided to press on ourselves. Then, while Erny took a break to play Frisbee, Lys continued with the insulation. It was sweaty, dusty work, but immensely satisfying to see the walls and ceiling filling out and providing more space in the loft.\nInsulating the walls\nView from the loft\nOne unexpected benefit of the insulation was the sound dampening effect. Lys didn\u0026rsquo;t notice at first, but once the insulation was in place, the outside noise was significantly reduced, and there was no echo inside. And, it is actually warmer than the outside when the temperature has dropped! This allows us to work longer into the evening and highlights how cosy the tiny house will be once we are finished. Now, we\u0026rsquo;re left pondering what to do with the scraps of insulation. If anyone has any creative ideas, we\u0026rsquo;re all ears!\nIn addition to the insulation, we started putting up the house wrap. Lys was struggling quite a bit using the hammer, so high near the ceiling, and the wrap was proving to be ungainly. Our friend Charlie came to the rescue with a practical tip: using a domestic stapler instead of clout nails for the ceiling. This method proved much easier and efficient, we don‚Äôt have to hire one for the weekend (even though we love the tool library) nor do we have to purchase one new. Erny became quite the master at installing the house wrap, climbing up and down the ladder and working at precarious angles to ensure everything was perfectly secured.\nWrapping the inside of the house\nDefinitely a work in progress\nAs we conclude July, we find ourselves reflecting on the journey so far. A huge thank-you goes to James for his expertise and for teaching us a bit about electrical work. With all the wiring done, walls and ceilings insulated, and the house wrap nearly complete, we\u0026rsquo;ve achieved quite a bit. We are actually all coming down with colds (Erny‚Äôs nose is running like a tap and Lys had a 4-day migraine) so hopefully we can move at a sustainable pace. Looking forward to an equally productive August ü§û\nCatch ya later, Lys \u0026amp; Erny\nAll smiles on the building site\n","href":"/themiette/posts/2024-june-july-build-update/","title":"June and July Build Update"},{"content":"My goodness hasn‚Äôt it been a time ‚Äî feels like we haven‚Äôt written a post in a long time.

We‚Äôve been using the wood that we salvaged from the shed and most recently, our stocks of usable wood are dwindling. Erny however, Erny has truly embraced his inner #dadoftheinternet, finding scrap pieces that fit perfectly. He really embodies this meme.\nJokes aside, the wall came together effortlessly, (almost too easily), allowing us to delineate spaces within the tiny house. With a new wall up, the space seems definitely smaller. The speed of its construction took us by surprise, with the wall going up in just a day. With this new-found momentum, we decided to start on our loft as well.\nOur internal wall\nMaking the loft, we discovered that toe nailing the joists was as strong as using joist hangers and a much better approach than end nailing. By placing the joists 45 cm on centre, we ensured they could support our weight and all the storage. The result is a remarkably sturdy structure. As an avid climbers - this excites us as we have more confidence to install a hangboard onto the loft joists now! Installing the loft quickly allowed us to see where the kitchen will be in the space. With extra time (for once, we were running ahead of schedule), we decided to press on installing the loft floorboards. In April, we completed a third of the loft floor (and subsequently finished the floor), and Erny and Lys even enjoyed hash browns sitting on our second floor! The addition of the loft and the bathroom wall has made the space feel smaller and cosy, yet it provides the much-needed context. Visitors are often amazed by how spacious it feels, which is quite deceiving! The tiny house is starting to feel like the 14 sqm that it‚Äôs measured to be.\nStarting our loft\nEating hashbrowns\nInstalling the loft floor\nAmidst the progress, Lys finds solace in the tiny house during her lunch breaks. It\u0026rsquo;s so peaceful, offering a tranquil escape from the work day. However, the process was not without problems ‚Äî we found two corner leaks. Honestly, we weren‚Äôt too sure how to fix them ‚Äî but we\u0026rsquo;ve given it a red hot shot. For one of them, we have silicone-d all the edges. Lys became a master of the caulking gun ‚Äî which, honestly, is harder than it looks. For the second leak, Erny has taped the batten down with waterproof tape, but we‚Äôre not sure if that will be a sustainable long term fix. It‚Äôs difficult because our diagonal cladding wicks all the water down to that corner, we definitely did not consider that when we installed cladding at the diagonal!\nMay: Navigating Challenges and New Beginnings May brought its own set of challenges. We started working on the bathroom floor and making detailed design plans. We hauled the shower tray out of the garage that we had purchase months ago for a steal at $150. It‚Äôs always very satisfying using up materials that we have purchased from an age ago. The bathroom floor posed a unique challenge as we wanted it to be at the same height as the floorboards. To achieve this, we created an inset plywood base, supported by small wooden structures and filled with insulation. Each square required the precise installation of four wooden pieces to fit like a puzzle. It was an incredibly finicky process, and we are still not sure if it will be worth the effort, but we do know that the floor is nice and level with a gentle fall to the drain grate.\nWorking on the bathroom floor\nThen, after weeks of hard work, we took a much-needed break and travelled to Adelaide, Singapore, and Indonesia. The trip provided a refreshing escape, and we even created a little video to share our adventures.\nJune: Refreshed and Ready Refreshed from our holiday, this June/July we‚Äôre planning on bringing some professionals onto the build ‚Äî namely James ‚Äî one of Erny‚Äôs sparkie friends, as well as starting to build our own kitchen cabinets. It‚Äôll be a lot of design work and reconfiguration. Erny, always the bargain hunter, found an incredible range hood on Facebook Marketplace that was unused from a renovation so we will be designing around that. This high-quality undermount range hood is a perfect addition to our kitchen.\nWhile there\u0026rsquo;s still so much to do, working on the inside of our tiny house has been incredibly satisfying. Each step forward brings us closer to finishing! We can also work inside the tiny house when it‚Äôs raining, so Lys complains less about the weather. It has, however, been rather chilly with quite a few cold snaps, so we have struggled to wake up early to make maximum use of the Winter sun. Next post will hopefully focus on a June/July update ‚Äî see you soon!\nCatch ya later, Lys \u0026amp; Erny\nHoliday Snaps - Gardens By the Bay\nHoliday Snaps - Mt Rinjani Crater Rim\nHoliday Snaps - Mt Rinjani\n","href":"/themiette/posts/2024-apr-may-build-update/","title":"April and May Build Update"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/inside/","title":"inside"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/singapore/","title":"singapore"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/wall/","title":"wall"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/door/","title":"door"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/easter/","title":"Easter"},{"content":"Well hello there, long time no write. Not really sure where all the time went, but let‚Äôs start in February and make our way through the months, shall we?\nTable Of Contents\rFebruary - Breaks and Supply Chain Delays March Easter Build-Athlon What\u0026rsquo;s next? February - Breaks and Supply Chain Delays To begin, in February, our tiny house project took a bit of a breather, allowing us to indulge in some personal pursuits. Erny played some Frisbee, which offered a welcome break from the tiny house grind. Lys bought a new second hand road-bike and promptly caught COVID-19. Writing and reflecting on this now, it really does feel like an eon ago. Construction wise, we finished the diagonal portion of the outside wall and Evan gifted us some privacy vinyl for our windows.\nA significant milestone arrived in the form of a huge plywood delivery, weighing over a tonne and necessitating a crane for transportation. It was a bit scary watching this huge and somewhat expensive purchase teeter over the fence and onto the lawn. We may have scuffed the lawn up a little‚Ä¶ We spent that afternoon into night manoeuvring over 50 sheets of plywood into the garage and the house. We are pretty excited to get started using the plywood because that means‚Ä¶we‚Äôll be working on the inside!\nPlywood delivery\nPlywood storage\nSomething less exciting to end February was our first experience of supply delays, with our door hardware being significantly delayed. We had ordered from a local hardware store (the store actually only a few suburbs away) and had requested delivery with the thought that we would save time. Unfortunately, they didn‚Äôt actually have the door hardware in stock, and we didn‚Äôt know this from the website. We were left hanging for a week‚Ä¶ and then two weeks‚Ä¶with little to no correspondence. Lys had to phone and email twice to track the parcel. To be fair, it‚Äôs not a huge deal since we didn‚Äôt even have a door installed yet!\nMarch Easter Build-Athlon Moving along in the timeline, we had an early Easter in March, so we had our annual Easter Build-Athlon. Build-Athlon isn\u0026rsquo;t a real word but it\u0026rsquo;s a pretty apt description. Every year, we set aside 10 days to just focus on construction (no more weekend warriors for us!) and we normally see mammoth progress. Last year during Easter we raised our walls and this year we were hoping to finally finish the outside and start on the inside.\nThe weekend began with a flurry of activity. We finished off the door frame that we had started in January. Our hinges had finally come in the mail, so we squared everything up and installed the doors. We unfortunately had cut our rough opening a centimetre too small, so we were fussing with the doors quite a bit to ensure that they closed. To be frank, the doors still aren‚Äôt perfect, which comes with building with second hand items, but we (read Erny) will continue to fiddle with them until they suit our needs.\nWe have a door!\nAll smiles when you have a door\nThen we turned our attention to finishing the cladding on the final wall with our free pine cladding that we cladded the picture window with. Over time, we‚Äôve mastered the techniques of weatherboard and ship lap cladding ‚Äî not experts by any stretch, but enough to speed through the final section of the wall. It was nice to get in a state of flow, Erny measuring and cutting the pieces and Lys painting and attaching them to the battens. We were also blessed by some beautiful sunny Autumn days, and it made working outside so much easier.\nAs we finally installed the last piece of cladding, Lys started cleaning the inside of the trailer. The inside has slowly become a bit of a store house, but everything needed to be cleaned, dusted and vacuumed in prep to move construction inside. The Makita vacuum that Erny bought got a serious run for its money. A highlight of the weekend was Lys‚Äô mother‚Äôs corgi butt sized brioche ‚Äî some delicious carbs to power us through the long days.\nNutella and Brioche\nMonday rolled round, and we continued to make the Makita vacuum work overtime, setting ourselves up to start on the floor. We also installed the final piece of Surf mist flashing on the top of the wall ‚Äî we can now say that our exterior walls are all closed up! We now entered unfamiliar territory ‚Äî work on the inside. We first started insulating the floor with EarthWool. We had purchased this insulation in late 2022 so it feels really nice finally to utilising the resources that we have been saving. The insulation is soft, but a little itchy ‚Äî it‚Äôs made out of recycled glass and sand. It also cuts so satisfyingly with a utility knife‚Ä¶ To make the work move faster, we listened to podcasts ‚Äî James Acaster and Ed Gamble‚Äôs podcast ‚ÄúOff Menu‚Äù and Atlas Obscure being on regular rotation.\nPreparing the floor\nCutting insulation to size\nAfter insulation came silver wrap vapour barrier in preparation for blackbutt floorboards. Technically the vapour barrier is optional, vapour barriers serve as an impenetrable guard, preventing moisture from infiltrating through. Since Lys spills liquids from cups often, it‚Äôs probably a good idea for us üòá.\nReady for floorboards\nReady for floorboards, we began installing the floor! This was a huge moment! Firstly, the blackbutt floorboards were one of the first items that we had purchased in 2022 (or was it 2021?) and secondly starting the inside feels like starting a new chapter of our build. It was slow-going and very frustrating with us breaking drill bits, stripping screws and cracking tongues of the hardwood. Installing your own hardwood floorboards is not for the faint-hearted. Hours became days, and we averaged about five rows a day. Then, our progress became slightly delayed by a freak Thursday rainstorm. Slightly worried, we had a few surges of energy on the Friday and managed to install over 12 boards in one day!\nInstalling floorboards\nA stripped screw that will be difficult to remove\nAlmost finished floor\nA Build-Athlon would not be complete without some friends! Daum and Gabby were the first to come down and say hi with their gorgeous dog, named Ghost. It‚Äôs always so nice to see people marvel at the house and at the progress that we have made. It gives us time to have a break, reflect and truly take in how far we have come so far on our build journey.\nNext, Michael and Troy came by to shoot the breeze and learn how to use the table saw. We put them to work sanding and cutting ‚Äî as usual, many hands make light work even for a short amount of time. Michael even stayed to help us open our skylight! Watching the sisalation be cut and using the handle to slowly open the skylights was extremely nerve-wracking, but we actually had no problems!\nThe usual suspects, Bel and Silvia, graced us with their presence as always. Silvia lent us some lights so we could work for longer, and as our knees and backsides started to hurt and protest under the strain of labour, our wonderful friends and family cracked jokes and shared lunch ‚Äî making it all better.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next? As the second weekend rolled around, and our backsides were protected by some cushions, we installed board after board ‚Äî 28 in total. We must say, having a floor is a huge quality of life increase. It feels unfamiliar walking around with no fear of accidentally falling if your foot misses a floor joist and having a stable foundation to have cheeky naps on üòÇ Okay ‚Äî enough writing ‚Äî enjoy some photos. Even though April is almost over, we think we‚Äôll just include our reflections with the May build update ‚Äî stay tuned!\nCatch ya later, Lys \u0026amp; Erny\nMichael on the table saw\nTroy sanding away\nOpening up the skylight\n","href":"/themiette/posts/2024-feb-mar-build-update/","title":"February and March Build Update"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/floorboards/","title":"floorboards"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/makita/","title":"makita"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/pine/","title":"pine"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/cedar/","title":"cedar"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/frame/","title":"frame"},{"content":"Our first update for 2024! 2024 has well and truly started with what feels like a huge January. Among the noteworthy developments was new eye protection! But jokes aside, we got some new eye-glasses from Bunnings and these are crystal clear with exceptional comfort, with Erny forgetting that they‚Äôre even on his face or on his head. They have swiftly become an indispensable asset ‚Äî and it‚Äôs the little things, you know?\nTable Of Contents\rPainting is harder than it looks\u0026hellip; New Makita tools! What\u0026rsquo;s next? Erny with new eyewear and the new drop saw\nPainting is harder than it looks\u0026hellip; January saw us pick up some brushes to get our painting on. The seemingly straightforward task revealed intricacies involving precise cutting and meticulous brushwork. The entrance of Lys\u0026rsquo; father (who painted to earn pocket money in his youth), who gave us some tips, making the whole endeavour less painful. We learnt that Erny is not very handy with a brush (he‚Äôs got to have some fatal flaws somewhere), so Lys and her father did most of the painting. It‚Äôs honestly magical what a coat of paint can do, and it really ties the entire house together.\nPainting\nJanuary saw us facing our fears ‚Äî working on the door frame. Lys cut into the subfloor to make way for the door frame, while Erny set about planning what said door frame should look like. We had help though with special guests Jo and Mandi joined forces for a productive session, contributing to the installation of final battens and the cladding divider for our fourth wall. This meant that Erny and Lys could focus on the door frame pieces while still progressing on the wall preparation.\nWorking on the door frame\nJo and Mandi!\nNew Makita tools! We also welcomed a new member to our Makita family! Erny\u0026rsquo;s adeptness in uncovering hidden gems on Facebook Marketplace manifested in the acquisition of a compound saw (drop saw) at a fraction of its retail price. He snapped up a huge compound saw for only $130! That is an actual steal. The cutting blade was even bigger than what we had hoped for, and it has already proved its usefulness. We decided (against our better judgement, but also it was the only solution) that we would install the cedar cladding diagonally for design contrast. This meant that each piece required several 45 degree cuts before installation. Within the first few days, we cut angle after angle using the new saw. While the installation is much slower, no one can deny that the diagonal cladding looks extremely stylish and really highlights the cedar wood grain.\nNew toy\nOne of the many 45 degree cuts\nCurrent progress\nThe Australian Open saw us slightly distracted, with us ending our days glued to the TV watching a lot of tennis (inevitably making morning wake-ups difficult). But what was more challenging was the 36-degree heatwave made its presence felt in late January, impacting progress. Erny persevered, working on demanding diagonal 45-degree cuts amid the oppressive heat, whilst Lys suffered migraines. Bel popped by to lend a hand, but really the lesson here is: do not work through a heatwave over 30 degrees.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next? Currently, Erny‚Äôs at a Frisbee tournament (a well deserved break) providing Lys with the opportunity to put together a short video. It‚Äôs a little throwback to April 2023 where some of our friends popped by to help raise the walls. It‚Äôs nice to reminisce and reflect on the whole journey, so hope you check it out if you have a spare 10 minutes.\nCatch ya later, Lys \u0026amp; Erny\n","href":"/themiette/posts/2024-jan-build-update/","title":"Jan Build Update"},{"content":"Our Last 2023 Build Update Hello and happy new year! We hope your break was filled with relaxation and joy. Ours was a mix of hard work and a few breakthroughs in our tiny house project. Let\u0026rsquo;s catch you up on our latest adventures.\nTable Of Contents\rChristmas Chronicles Welcoming the New Year with Wall #3 January Goals What\u0026rsquo;s next? Christmas Chronicles Did anyone experience hail in your area? We were, once again, in a relentless race against daylight and unpredictable weather. The elements threw everything at us, from rain to scorching 40-degree days, and even a hail spell! Erny spent most of the break looking at the Weatherzone app to make sure we would always be in the clear. Even with these curveballs, over Christmas, our tiny house saw significant progress.\nHail in summer\nStarting the third wall\nWe successfully completed the long wall ‚Äî a cause to pop some champagne (or whatever beverage of your choice may be). Installing weatherboards around the window proved particularly tricky, adding an extra layer of complexity as we ascended. We had to cut the boards to size fitting around the window, but each weatherboard has its own twists and bows, so everything needed to be custom fit. The higher we climbed on our ladders, the more demanding the installation process became.\nUsing the circular saw to fit the boards around\nA pleasant December surprise came in the form of a visit from Silvia and Amanda, who came by to provide some moral support. Amanda is taking a hand tools course, a skill set that, in hindsight, we realised would have been incredibly useful at the beginning of our project. Lesson learned for future builders!\nTo finish off the wall and prepare for the upcoming gutter installation, we invested in custom-made flashing. Installing this was difficult and very finicky. We needed to cut down our corners to size and redo some of the roof! The result not only looked impressive but also offered a sigh of relief as the wall\u0026rsquo;s completion meant less tarping to protect against rain. Throughout Christmas, we must have tarped the house over 5 times. A clever addition to enhance stability was the introduction of two pop rivets in the center of the flashing (this was a Lys brainwave). These keeps the pieces in place and flush too to the wall.\nInstall brass screws\nWelcoming the New Year with Wall #3 After a short escape down South, our focus shifted to the third wall, and this time around, the process has been notably smoother. Erny\u0026rsquo;s honed skill in accurately cutting each weatherboard to size, considering the timber\u0026rsquo;s twists and turns, has streamlined the workflow. With a helping hand from Bel, who assisted with adding battens and oiling the cladding ends. It‚Äôs always so nice to have friends come around. Even the soffits went up seamlessly, a stark contrast to the challenges faced during the first wall installation. Our first soffit took over a weekend, but this soffit took less than half a day.\nCleaning our surfmist colorbond roof\nJanuary Goals While undoubtedly tiring, the satisfaction of making sustained progress over the break has been immensely rewarding. The longer days of summer have certainly worked in our favour. Upon reflection, we have also learnt a considerable amount about ourselves. Erny is a perfectionist, and slight cosmetic flaws bug him to the nth degree. Lys really likes to see progress and is sometimes too one-track minded. Because of this, our estimation skills have become more grounded, perhaps more realistic, as we\u0026rsquo;ve navigated the intricacies of tiny house construction.\nWe also have an expanding toolkit of technical skills (get it!). Lys can now confidently wield the table saw, and Erny is a circular saw fiend. He even took the circular saw to work to fix some monitor stands! It is so rewarding gaining some level of mastery, if not amateur confidence, to build something that you once dreamed of.\nUnfortunately, we did not manage to finish the exterior by the 31st December ‚Äî so we‚Äôre trying our luck for the end of January. Simultaneously, we are contemplating simplifying the interior design. The joking request to move in by Christmas 2024 has spurred this consideration ‚Äì apparently, the family prefers relaxation over the new year\u0026rsquo;s break instead of holding ladders!\nLys\u0026rsquo; brother helpig out\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next? A heartfelt ‚ÄúThank You‚Äù goes out to our family \u0026amp; friends ‚Äì Dan, Troy, Michael, Jason, Silvia, and Bel ‚Äì whose unwavering support has made this endeavour not just manageable but enjoyable. Bel, in particular, has been quick to remind us to document our progress and celebrate wins. With this in mind ‚Äî we can‚Äôt garuntee more documented progress but hopefully we will do more celebrating in 2024!\nHere is to a constructive 2024!

November has been a month of highs, lows, and, of course, more cladding adventures. So, grab your virtual hard hat, and let\u0026rsquo;s dive into the nitty-gritty details.\nTable Of Contents\rMaking Our Soffits Pretty (and giving us headaches) What‚Äôs next? Our journey begins with drumroll‚Ä¶ putting finishing touches on a wall, and oh, what a journey it has been. The internal debate raged on: to cover the corner where cladding meets, should we go with Surfmist steel corner flashing or the charm of contrasting wood trim? In the end, the warmth of wood won us over, embracing its subtle curves and warps over time. We kicked things off by cutting and installing some Douglas fir corners. It might not be as durable as steel, but it looks undeniably great! These corners were definitely a challenge to install as we started using those beautiful yet painful brass screws. We bought these in June if you, dear reader, remember and now making they were grand debut.\nBut alas, the pain set early ‚Äî they kept slipping out of the drill bit, and they\u0026rsquo;re not self-tapping, and they need to be counter-sunk. All this compounded and added an extra layer of complexity for the installation. Silvia and Deniz, our wise friends, had warned us (read as Lys), and now we understand why. Flat head screws are so finicky! Even screwing just 18 screws (1.8% of the total screws that we have to install), the head of the impact driver played hard to get, slipping here and there, and the softer brass demanded careful handling to avoid dents. Yet, the end result? A visually stunning contrast of gold brass against the warm tones of our orange wood ‚Äì a classic combination that\u0026rsquo;s hard to beat.\nWith corners and battens securely in place, we turned our attention to installing the first set of cladding: discarded pine weatherboards Erny unearthed from a previous build ‚Äî for free no less! Grime-covered and weathered, these boards had seen better days. After a thorough cleaning, we painstakingly measured, painted the ends, and aligned them with precision. Lys, at this point, was starting to appreciate why some opt for the simplicity of Colorbond wall cladding. It took us 4 days to clad the far wall, and we puttied all the screw holes and sanded everything down ready for paint!\nStarting to add cladding\nMaking Our Soffits Pretty (and giving us headaches) Just as we thought we had conquered the wall, the realisation hit ‚Äì completing the soffit was crucial for that clean finish. Our November goal shifted gears from ‚ÄúLet\u0026rsquo;s clad this wall!‚Äù to ‚ÄúWe have to defeat this soffit!‚Äù. Luckily we had some cedar ship lap, saved from landfill earlier in the year. It was too short to be installed on a wall, but was the perfect size for the soffit. Cedar is also light, termite-resistant, and antifungal, so it is a great cladding option. Installing these small cedar pieces posed a challenge, especially high up on the ladder with a vertical drill. Our neck muscles got a workout, and it was a bit painful to look up, but teamwork prevailed. Lys handled drilling and pilot holes on the ground below, Erny took charge of installation, and after a few miscommunications, everything eventually fell into place.\nPreparing the brass screws for installation\nInstalling the soffit\nNow, onto the long back wall, the one with the fewest windows but its own set of challenges. On a 30-degree Sunday, Bel joined the crew, installing the lower half of the battens while Erny and Lys focused on the corner. Then we managed to get our first four weatherboards onto the house. Workflow became smoother; brass screws on the corner once again looked slick, and this time the installation was less painful. Silva had recommended using a screw guide, and this was a godsend. There is a sheath that goes over the screw and keeps it from slipping. It is a bit disconcerting because you can\u0026rsquo;t see the head of the screw, however, we are slowly getting the hang of it. We\u0026rsquo;ve also purchased a screwdriver with magnetic interchangeable heads, which has allowed us to make the screw head slots vertical. It\u0026rsquo;s very satisfying hand finishing the screws, however it is a bit of a labour of love. On the topic of labour, Bel suggested that we line up the pine cladding with the cedar cladding at the corner, for a seamless look. This means that we\u0026rsquo;ll have to use a few extra boards, but we think we\u0026rsquo;ll have enough resources. Only time will tell on this one‚Ä¶\nStarting the long wall with the western red cedar\nWhat‚Äôs next? There is still so much to do on the tiny house if we want to get to lock up by the 31st. We are currently focusing on the back wall, however we still need to find a correctly sized deadlock for the door, and we also need to create a door jamb.

The past months have been a whirlwind of adventure, starting with a journey to the United States for a wedding - congratulations Visrut and Ruhani! We travelled from Australia to the U.S. and embarked on an adventure that took us from the vibrant streets of New Orleans all the way to the iconic city of New York. Along the way, we had the pleasure of exploring the stunning natural beauty of the Smoky Mountains National Park. Our hike along a small section of the Appalachian Trail was a definite highlight. A huge shout-out to Kat, Erny\u0026rsquo;s frisbee friend, for being our guide and teaching us about hemlock, spruce, and fir trees.\nWe also stayed in a teeny tiny house in Asheville, NC. It was hand made and very much inspired by Jay Shafer, author of The Small House Book. We\u0026rsquo;ve stayed in a few tiny houses now and this one was filled with wood, wonderful books and was smaller than ours (sitting at a pretty 9.1 square meters)! You can find their listing on Airbnb here.\nRustic and very blue exterior\nCute roof design\nLook at that wooden interior of the tiny house\nTiny kitchen\nWhat we returned to in October Upon our return, however, we were met with an unexpected challenge. The cladding we had lovingly oiled for our tiny house had begun to turn green. Naturally, we (read Lys only) were distressed and initially suspected it was mould. Spot cleaning efforts were in vain, prompting us to seek assistance from the helpful Cutek Oil team. They enlightened us about a copper additive in the oil that can, on rare occasions, cause light-coloured wood to turn green. Apparently they don\u0026rsquo;t see this happen often - luck was not on our side, and we were among the \u0026ldquo;unlucky\u0026rdquo; few. The good news is that this greenish tint should fade over time. If we\u0026rsquo;re feeling impatient, we can opt for an acidic wash to expedite the process. We\u0026rsquo;re still contemplating our next steps, but it\u0026rsquo;s a relief to know that our cladding isn\u0026rsquo;t harbouring mould.\nSmall freak outs as the cedar turns green\nThe acid wash cleans the green hue off excellently\nOur construction efforts continue, with a focus on cladding the short wall of our tiny house (with pine weatherboards that Erny got for free). Achieving a level finish has proven to be quite the challenge, and our workflow is deliberate and time-consuming. Each piece requires custom cutting to accommodate the picture window, painting of the ends, a patient wait for them to dry, and meticulous pre-drilling of holes before the final installation. It\u0026rsquo;s a labour of love, but with each addition, our tiny house is taking on the appearance of a true home. It\u0026rsquo;s also the final layer of protection, giving our hard-working sisalation a well-deserved break.\nAdding battens\nStarting to clad the wall\nWorking late into the night\nWhat‚Äôs next? All in all, it\u0026rsquo;s been pretty slow-going. Our goal is to complete the exterior of the house by the end of the year, with December 31st being our unofficial deadline. We\u0026rsquo;ve got a few hurdles to solve like what sort of lock we\u0026rsquo;ll use on our vintage French doors (a problem we\u0026rsquo;ve been procrastinating on) and installing over 1000 flat head screws. However, life has a way of throwing delightful distractions our way, like Christmas parties, weddings, and celebrations.

August has been a whirlwind of challenges, cleaning, and mad dash purchases but we\u0026rsquo;ve managed to make some significant roofing progress on our tiny house. Buckle up, because we\u0026rsquo;ve got quite the adventure to share!\nWhat we\u0026rsquo;ve done As we kicked off August, we found ourselves juggling two passions: our relentless dedication to our tiny house project (read as: desperation to finish the roof before we leave for the US) and the thrilling tension of the Women\u0026rsquo;s World Cup (go the Matildas!). Our multitasking skills were put to the test as we cheered for our favourite teams while meticulously measuring and constructing.\nFirstly, we spent an absolute age on a cleaning mission, Our surf mist colorbond, which we had purchased from a finished renovation on the Central Coast had been sitting in the garden for quite a while gathering leaves, dirt and the occasional leech. Armed with water pressure and determination, we worked to restore these pieces to their former shining glory (in some sense quite literally - the surf mist colour really reflects the sun). Note to self - store your materials properly to avoid having to clean them when you need them 8 months later.\nCleaning our surfmist colorbond roof\nInstalling battens\nAugust also saw Lys stepping into the role of an angle grinder enthusiast. Armed with everyday tools - a sharpie and a bed slat - she tackled the task of precision cutting our roof pieces to size. Bricks played a supporting role, steadying the pieces and she has worked up quite a technique. Meanwhile, Erny did an amazing job installing the battens onto the roof. It was a bit of a trial and error process to cut and then install. We definitely believe he has nerves of steel, because he was definitely quite high up on the ladder. Things were going well\u0026hellip;until an ordering mishap. The roof screws we had initially ordered were too long (50 mm), posing a potential water leakage risk - what a disaster. This really took the wind out of our sails.\nIn a moment of quick thinking, we devised several solutions:\nUse the screws that we had and risk the water (no thank you) Buy 200 screws in the correct colour from a supplier in melbourne (we need 250) Buy 1000 screws in the correct colour but no neoprene washer from a supplier in perth (once again we only need 250!) Buy 250 screws from bunnings and spray paint the tops in the correct colour Ultimately, we decided on the last minute dash to Bunnings (you\u0026rsquo;ll soon notice a last-minute dash to Bunnings theme in August). There, we secured shorter screws and spray paint to camouflage their tops with the roof. This task also introduced Lys to the oddly satisfying world of spray painting. Bar this slight calamity, the long side of the roof went on without a hitch (all of Erny\u0026rsquo;s hard work). The battens were installed quickly, the colorbond was cut to the correct size and we powered through the install - things were looking good. We were ready for the more complex shorter side!\nMad dash to bunnings to buy spray paint\nSpray painting the tops of the screws\nOne side of the roof looking good!\nErny working very hard\nWe were feeling pretty confident about installing the skylights and the flashing because it\u0026rsquo;s the first item that we\u0026rsquo;ve bought new that\u0026rsquo;s come with manufacturer instructions - think IKEA flat pack instructions on steroids. What we forgot was how heavy the skylights were. Tentatively, under the watchful eye of Lys\u0026rsquo; parents we hauled up the skylights 4 meters up and onto the roof. We then were ready for the flashing until Erny discovered that the flashing was too large for our roof! We made some slight modifications - trimming the metal to size and fiddling with the bottom edge - hopefully the changes won\u0026rsquo;t impact the water draining qualities but that remains to be seen. We also added extra roofing underlay under the flashing to wick water away but an unexpected rain shower during installation forced a hasty application. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t a flawless job, but Lys\u0026rsquo; excuse was a battle with laryngitis ‚Äì and something is better than nothing right? Our hypothesis was soon tested with a 40 mm deluge - the skylights seem to be okay so we are confident that our waterproofing skills can handle more than a little bit of rain.\nOne skylight in!\nAn aside about our skylight flashing We don\u0026rsquo;t know if we have written about this before but we actually bought our skylights a few months back from a nice man on the beaches. Unfortunately for us, he had a tiled roof but we were installing a colorbond roof and his roofer had removed a piece of cladding flashing away. This part is pretty important when it comes to water proofing\u0026hellip;And thus began a wild goose chase finding a Velux supplier who would sell us this spare part (we touch upon this on our June Build Update).\nWe finally found a team in June who could source the parts from Velux, and we went to pick them up after 3 weeks of the order being lost, but then - it turned out Velux had delivered the incorrect part! We contacted the supplier who worked with Velux to deliver us our correct part 2 weeks later. We got the part back home - pretty relieved - only to realise that they did not provide us with enough screws for the full install. We just cut our losses and installed the cladding without the screws for now but we will need to pop our own in - what a journey!\nYet more hurdles awaited, with colorbond panels somehow ending up 8 cm too short. We were so sure that we had measured twice to cut once - but clearly we must have misread the tape measure\u0026hellip;twice. Fortunately, the ridge capping came to the rescue, concealing the discrepancy while still remaining watertight. We decided to push forward with the colorbond install and not re-cut new pieces. This was a good decision - by the time the weekend over we had the skylights in and the second half of the colorbond installed - what an achievement! We were so close to completing the roof, or so we thought.\nInstalling the short pieces of colorbond\nAlas, the construction journey remains an ever-evolving learning curve. Our path took an unexpected turn when we realized that fascia would be a necessary addition before installing the ridge capping ‚Äì a future problem that suddenly required immediate attention. Originally we had been hoping to install the ridge capping first and leave the eaves until later. This wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have worked aesthetically as the ridge cap needs to be the final piece installed (think of it like the cherry on top of the ice cream Sunday). We would like to thank Metal Roofing Online Roofing tutorials for helping us avoid a potential aesthetic roofing faux pas.\nQuick thinking and a pay to win attitude led us to purchase pre-primed fascia from Bunnings, with an added layer of convenience in having the pieces cut to size by the helpful staff. A slight consolation was that we saved $3 dollars as he didn\u0026rsquo;t charge us for the cuts (apparently it\u0026rsquo;s actually $1 a cut at Bunnings). We also needed to buy a pop rivet gun - a tool we had hoped to hire - since we had just ran out of time.\nLys got to work painting the pieces in surfmist, as Erny crafted angles to cut the pieces but we faced yet another challenge ‚Äì ensuring that barge capping would align seamlessly with our varied cladding designs. We halted the build to labour on the problem with Erny uncovering more problems. This intricate process demanded meticulous mathematical calculations, quite a bit of trigonometry and an abundance of patience. We think we have a plan (it involves purchasing a different style of metal cladding) but it\u0026rsquo;s a puzzle we\u0026rsquo;ll continue to solve as we progress, post our planned US trip. We also battled a new product called butyl tape. This tape is like bluetac on steroids - it sticks to everything in sight! We also learnt that it\u0026rsquo;s harder to work with as the ambient air temperature cools - something we discovered as we were racing against the afternoon sun. Bar the maths and the stickiness, the install went very well and it we are quite pleased with our handy work! The barge capping over the eave really adds to the feel of the house and we are quite pleased with our colour choice.\nLate night whiteboard maths to make sure everything fits under the height limit\nPainting the facia board\nCutting facia to size\nAs we observe the barge capping, fascia, and the evolving roof of our tiny house, we acknowledge that while it might not be perfect, it certainly holds character. A friend with experience in construction aptly put it: \u0026ldquo;If you look at fully constructed houses, it never looks perfect. I guarantee you 9.8/10 people won\u0026rsquo;t be able to tell. But you never notice because it\u0026rsquo;s all chaos which falls into a nice harmony.\u0026rdquo; We are taking comfort in the very statistically accurate 9.8 people who won\u0026rsquo;t notice the minor flaws in our install and grateful for friends who know just the right things to say üíï.\nIt wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a tiny house build without a fancy sandwich with fancy local bakery bread\nThe concept of a 1.5 person job As our project has progressed, we have come to terms with the reality of \u0026ldquo;1.5 person jobs.\u0026rdquo; Holding ladders, passing tools, and lending that extra hand often require the skills of half a person ‚Äì the unsung hero of construction teams. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s a lack of tools or the absence of the perfect clamp, we learned that embracing teamwork is essential for efficient progress. It\u0026rsquo;s also a reminder that as a duo, we can\u0026rsquo;t always maximize efficiency, and that\u0026rsquo;s perfectly acceptable.We\u0026rsquo;re work shopping it üôÇ\nAnyway - it\u0026rsquo;s been a huge roof building month and it\u0026rsquo;s going to be a quiet September - we\u0026rsquo;re going on holiday! So we will see you soon ‚úàÔ∏è\nCatch ya later, Lys \u0026amp; Erny\nRoof is on!\n","href":"/themiette/posts/2023-aug-build-update/","title":"August Build Update"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/roof/","title":"roof"},{"content":"A July build update Windows are in!\nTable Of Contents\rWhat we\u0026rsquo;ve done Working on the water pooling solution What‚Äôs next? What we\u0026rsquo;ve done July has been window month. We are pretty proud to say that we\u0026rsquo;ve now got our hand made windows installed üôÇ - here is how it went!\nWe began with the bathroom window, which we thought would be a breeze. However, not even one window down we faced our first hiccup - it turns out the width of the window frame was not wide enough to run flush with the internal lining of the tiny house (on the inside) and flush with the exterior cladding on the outside. We were 8 mm short! Talk about a stressful first window weekend. After some deliberation we decided that we would cut an angle into our internal lining and make it a feature. This means that the exterior cladding will be flush giving a more waterproof seal, and we will have to get creative when we tackle the interior. Bar this - the bathroom window went in without a hitch!\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested, our workflow largely ran like this:\nLys, armed with her father\u0026rsquo;s vintage Stanley knife cut an I shape into the window cavity The edges were then sealed with aluminium tape starting from the bottom sill Vapourseal tape was added to the bottom of the sill to protect it from water and dampcourse was stapled underneath the window rough opening Flashing was stapled to the underside of the window (a step we forgot quite often) and then the heavy window was carefully lifted and wriggled into position Erny precisely packed the window to make it level and plumb whilst Lys got an arm work out holding the window in place A few screws and swears later the window would be finally in place üôÇ Finish off the flashing by sealing the sides with Vapourseal and stapling in more dampcourse Install the metal head flashing to the top and rejoice ‚ú® Prepared flashing corner\nLys measuring the flashing to size\nInstalling the window\nInstalled window corner\nFeeling inspired, we took on the kitchen window next. It proved to be a little more challenging due to its weight and handling difficulties. In our eagerness to position it, we forgot a crucial piece of vapour-seal on the sill. Lys could only describe her feelings in the form of this GIF.\nvia GIPHY\nAdditionally, it started to rain, and we realised another design flaw - water was pulling on our opening windows - a slight problem\u0026hellip; Adapting to the situation, we decided to continue with the other fixed window (the picture window) and work on a solution for the water pooling for the opening windows. Then we decided to circle back to fix the kitchen window when we have the resources, the theory being that by the time we have finished installing the other windows, we would have improved our flashing skills with each installation giving us confidence to fix our original mistakes.\nWorking on the water pooling solution To ensure the opening windows function perfectly and no longer pool during rain, we routed new channels and a slope into the frame. Erny\u0026rsquo;s patience and diligence with the router truly paid off during this process. During this time he broke all four 3 mm router bits! This was due to the Blackbutt timber being so hard. Here we learnt that router bits are way more expensive than drill bits and other wood work accessories.\nThe four broken bits\nThe routered drip edge\nErny working with the router\nThen, we had a minor router accident while working on the second loft window - somehow we veered the router off course and created a gouge in the lip of the window. We were a little frustrated with ourselves - at this point in July it felt like this window install was facing problem after problem. Determined not to be discouraged, Erny glued a piece back in and sanded it down to fit seamlessly with the new slope (if you don\u0026rsquo;t look too closely you don\u0026rsquo;t actually notice it) and besides, it will be 3 meters in the air, so it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t affect the aesthetics of the house dramatically. Guess there is nothing wood glue and putty can\u0026rsquo;t solve! üòÑ\nFixing the routered gouge\nBack on course we roped the whole family together and installed our big picture window. This window is HUUUGEEEE and needs three people to carry it. The installation was pretty stressful but now that it is in it looks fantastic. The abundance of natural light is a delightful preview of the warm moments we\u0026rsquo;ll enjoy once our tiny house is complete. Lys keeps talking about how she\u0026rsquo;s excited to have a cup of tea looking out of the window - and that vision is slowly getting closer and closer.\nFlashing the large window cavity\nInstalling the picture window\nLots of light in the tiny house\nOur last weekend on window duty really highlighted that we needed a break. It was slow-going, and we encountered a few mishaps. While installing the final loft window, Lys accidentally broke a beloved bee teacup when she tipped the staple gun slipped off a ladder. As we fixed the kitchen window Erny faced a few frustrations installing the last two windows with the Blackbutt timber tearing out. A few swears were definitely said in a multitude of languages. Despite these moments, we\u0026rsquo;re learning to embrace the imperfections and relish the character they bring to our tiny house. We\u0026rsquo;ve lost count of the amount of times we\u0026rsquo;ve consoled ourselves saying \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a feature, not a flaw\u0026rdquo;.\nRacing against the light to install our windows\nAs we look back on our experiences this month, we\u0026rsquo;ve learned some valuable lessons:\nSmall eaves can make a significant difference in both aesthetics and weather protection. It rained a bit throughout the process and we discovered our windows that had a little eave were by far more protected than the windows on the long sides. We\u0026rsquo;re definitely on the hunt now to install the gutters and roof. Custom window building is best left to the experts to avoid potential hiccups. (Lys vows to never do this again but concedes that we have learnt a lot) Borrowing tools from a well-stocked tool library can save the day. We\u0026rsquo;re really trying to avoid buying more tools and having a membership with the tool library has been a lifesaver! This time around we rented the staple gun (which came with complementary staples). It feels great to reduce costs and put these tools to work - a definite recommendation for anyone a bit tight on space but wants to dabble in DIY. Staple gun from the tool library\nWhat‚Äôs next? In a slight addendum, we\u0026rsquo;ve also finished oiling our cladding! What a milestone. We\u0026rsquo;re delighted with the progress we\u0026rsquo;ve made and are excited to continue our tiny house adventure - next month is roof month so definitely more problem solving on the horizon\u0026hellip;\nCatch ya later, Lys \u0026amp; Erny\nSmiles all around because the windows are in\n","href":"/themiette/posts/2023-jul-build-update/","title":"July Build Update"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/oiling/","title":"oiling"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/router/","title":"router"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/window/","title":"window"},{"content":"A June build update A lot of shopping and finally finishing sanding the cladding!\nTable Of Contents\rWhat we\u0026rsquo;ve done What\u0026rsquo;s next? What we\u0026rsquo;ve done The tail end of May and the month of June have been quite eventful, filled with a lot of shopping and unexpected visitors from far away states. Let\u0026rsquo;s dive right in!\nOur fanciest acquisition was a package of flathead brass screws that arrived in the mail. While elegant in appearance, they present a formidable challenge due to their soft composition and that flatheads are known for slipping and causing drills to gouge the timber. Every person that Lys shares this purchase with is flabbergasted on the screw choice - why pick something so challenging to work with? It turns out that inspiration can strike at any moment, and Lys found hers while passing through a fancy neighbourhood. She spotted a garage door adorned with western red cedar facing and beautiful brass nails. The sight left a lasting impression, but clearly Lys didn\u0026rsquo;t realise exactly what she was getting into\u0026hellip;we will see how we fare.\nOur very expensive flathead screws\nDecking oil also made its way to our doorstep (all the way from Western Australia), and we wasted no time in starting the oiling process. The product we chose is CUTEK¬Æ Extreme CD50, a high-performance, oil-based wood stabiliser with a self-healing effect. This Australian-made solution penetrates deeply into the timber, highlighting its natural grain and beauty while providing robust and long-lasting protection. It is quite nice to use a product built for the harsh Australian climate, but we\u0026rsquo;re trying out a few different oils on this build - it\u0026rsquo;ll be interesting to see how they age and weather over time.\nYou can really see the difference between the oiled wood and unoiled pieces\nOiled cladding pieces\nHowever, using CUTEK¬Æ Extreme CD50 comes with its own challenges. The rough sawn surface of our wood eagerly absorbs the oil, making it quite the thirsty endeavour. Additionally - it\u0026rsquo;s there has been a cold snap and the oil is taking much longer to penetrate and dry.\nOiled cladding in the drying zone\nOiled cladding close up\nTo expedite the process and make use of the good weather (read - lack of rain), we enlisted the help of Lys\u0026rsquo; brother, Tom, who proved to be an absolute champion at oiling duty. Having an extra pair of hands certainly makes the work fly by, and we\u0026rsquo;re grateful for his assistance.\nTom working hard oiling the cladding boards over the weekend\nHuge thank you to the best brother ever\nFinally, our more practical purchase (in an attempt to prepare for the next phase of our project) was dampcourse and flashing tape to flash and waterproof our windows. This will be crucial when the time comes to install them.\nA free hat with our flashing tape\nOnce again we\u0026rsquo;ve been inspired by Two Hands and A Tiny House with his flashing techniques. Lys has lost count how many times we\u0026rsquo;ve paused, played and repeated that video. We have also found these great videos by the Australian Glass and Window Association - the demonstrations are extremely clear and quite detailed.\nJune also saw some unexpected and helpful visitors! Our team expanded further with the dedication of Bel, Silvia, Lys, and Lys\u0026rsquo; mother, who spent many weekends sanding cedar weatherboards to the correct grit for installation. Together we refurbished and refreshed over 200 lineal meters of cladding starting from 80 grit to then 100 grit and then finally 120 grit. Huge thanks to their hard work and attention to detail.\nTea break when our friends come around\nOn the logistical front but still in the shopping haul theme, Erny took charge of getting quotes for a missing piece of our skylights. It was a huge relief to discover that the cost would be less than $150, making it a worthwhile investment to give our skylights a new lease on life. We\u0026rsquo;re excited to kick off the roof construction in July, and these skylights will undoubtedly be a fantastic addition. As we progress, - we\u0026rsquo;ve become aware of potential shortages in decking screws. It\u0026rsquo;s a reminder to always stay one step ahead and ensure we have an adequate supply of essential materials. Playing to his strengths, Erny estimated the remaining wood we have for the battens, internal wall, and loft sections. Luckily, it seems like we have just enough to complete these crucial elements without any delays or the need to purchase additional materials.\nAmidst the hard work, we\u0026rsquo;ve also made time for celebrations and cherished moments. Zy travelled all the way from Alice Springs on her birthday weekend to lend a hand with sanding and spend time with our chickens (pesky Agatha, Bertha and Clementine). Happy belated birthday, Zy!\nPutting our friends to work\nHappy Birthday Zy!\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next? As we venture into new territory, we\u0026rsquo;re currently strategising on how to install our windows. It\u0026rsquo;s a significant milestone that will transform our tiny house into a cosy and light-filled space. We\u0026rsquo;re researching different techniques, seeking advice from everywhere we can get it (thank you very much AGWA), and drawing on our own creativity to ensure the windows are installed in some shape and form. That\u0026rsquo;s it for now - June has been a month of challenges, inspiration, and progress. We appreciate everyone\u0026rsquo;s continued support and can\u0026rsquo;t wait to share more updates soon.\nCatch ya later, Lys \u0026amp; Erny\n","href":"/themiette/posts/2023-jun-build-update/","title":"June Build Update"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/sanding/","title":"sanding"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/shopping/","title":"shopping"},{"content":"An May build update Wrapping the tiny house like a present üéÅüéÅüéÅ\nTable Of Contents\rWhat we\u0026rsquo;ve done What\u0026rsquo;s next? What we\u0026rsquo;ve done Hello, hello! As May rolls on, the days are getting shorter, and our productivity has slowed down. Not to make this blog become a Let's complain about the weather blog, but with the weather changing, we\u0026rsquo;ve had to battle with the elements to get any work done. Sunny weekdays are always followed by rainy weekends, leaving us only a few good hours to work on our project. To find a silver lining, we have become masters of water management though - devising a very high tech system of tarps and buckets to ensure minimal pooling.\nWe love puddles\nOur focus has been on rushing to get the roof rafters up, but things are taking longer than anticipated. We\u0026rsquo;ve had to make a few tweaks and adjustments as we go, ensuring that everything is perfect. One of our biggest challenges has been installing noggins to the roof. It\u0026rsquo;s a fiddly job, requiring precision and patience due to using second-hand materials. We are installing three noggins between each rafter space, and it is looking good! Speaking of noggins - we\u0026rsquo;ve also installed our wall noggins to increase the structural integrity of the tiny house. This was unexpected and was partly due to the fact that Lys learnt how to use another tool - the circular saw. Honestly, it is not her favourite - it is ungainly and cumbersome to use with Lys\u0026rsquo; tiny little hands struggling to hold the circular saw steady. It is also dreadfully fussy and constantly complains (via not cutting properly, blade binding and making concerning noisy) and does not even cut accurately (totally not the fault of the user). But, because of Lys\u0026rsquo; ability to get over her hatred of the circular saw Erny was able to focus on installing those noggins.\nThe roof rafter structure\nThe roof noggins are up and installed\nWe also installed the eaves on the far ends of the house. This was particularly thrilling, being 3 meters in the air carrying a very heavy eave, but also because the house is starting to look like a real house. Huge thanks to Lys\u0026rsquo; brother and father for being MVPs holding ladders and being extra hands - could not have finished this job up in May without them! Erny also powered through and ripped through a bunch of roof battens in preparation for our roof install - it feels like things are really coming together.\nHowever, it would not be a build update with a slight mishap. While Lys was working on the ladder she dropped a hammer - which smashed straight through the plywood subfloor. It was bound to happen at one point, but it was incredibly frustrating. We have patched the hole (nothing that glue and plywood cannot fix) but it is still a downer.\nWe were then blessed with a stretch of sunny weather, so we made the decision to wrap the house. Inspired by a YouTuber and tiny house builder named Two Hands and a Tiny House, we opted to use Fletcher Foam Cell Shed Liner for our house wrap. This product is 5 millimetres thick, featuring a lime green foam core and an anti-glare covering (though the debate about the colour of the anti-glare covering is still ongoing between Lys, Bel, and Erny). Unlike other house wrap it is quite heavy and holds its structure. It took immense effort, three ladders, and unwavering determination to wrap the entire house. When you\u0026rsquo;re perched on a ladder 4 meters high holding a roll of foam, the world takes on a different perspective, and you appreciate the magnitude of your project.\nMeasuring the house wrap\nThe house wrap is very reflective\nThe incredible Bel\nBel stopped by on Saturday to lend an extra pair of hands with impeccable timing. Together we balanced precariously on ladders and clambered around tiny house noggins to tap in the clout nails and wrangle the foam wrap, making the process smoother and more efficient. By the end of Saturday (most likely due to Erny\u0026rsquo;s determination) we had finished two layers so sisalation! What a feat. Then, Silvia joined us on Sunday, and lent us her engineering wisdom to help us figure out the most efficient way to wrap the eaves and the roof with the remaining house wrap. After a bit of mathematics and calculations (on Erny\u0026rsquo;s part) later, together with Lys\u0026rsquo; family (father, mother and brother are working overtime on this project), we installed the final three pieces of sisalation over the roof as the afternoon turned to dusk.\nStrategising with Silvia\nIn a slight segue, Lys also took the opportunity to learn how to use the sled on the table saw to make roof spacers! It was a new skill to master, but with practice and Silvia\u0026rsquo;s supervision, she managed to create precise and uniform spacers that will ensure proper ventilation and airflow under the roof. We haven\u0026rsquo;t used them yet, but it\u0026rsquo;s all about those little details that make a big difference in the long run.\nHowever, the true test for our house wrap will come next week when rain is in the forecast. We\u0026rsquo;re curious to see how the material holds up against wind and water. Two Hands and a Tiny House says it held up, but time will tell. As a precaution, Lys has been busy taping up the bottom of the trailer with Fletcher Vapastop 883, a reinforced foil tape known for its exceptional strength, flexibility, and conformability. The aluminium tape provides an added layer of protection against moisture and helps seal any potential gaps. Lys isn\u0026rsquo;t 100% sure what the 883 stands for, but it\u0026rsquo;s getting the job done.\nTaping the edges to prevent water coming through\nErny working on the eave\nThe first section of the tiny house wrapped\nThe house wrapped at night\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next? Cladding, a window install\u0026hellip;maybe progress on a metal roof - who knows? Overall, May has been a month of challenges, adjustments, and learning experiences. While our productivity has slowed down with the shorter days, but clearly that hasn\u0026rsquo;t stopped us as we\u0026rsquo;ve made progress on important tasks like installing noggins, adding eaves, and wrapping the house. Each step brings the tiny house (also known as cubby house by the neighbours) closer to a reality, and it feels pretty surreal.\nCatch ya later, Lys \u0026amp; Erny\n","href":"/themiette/posts/2023-may-build-update/","title":"May Build Update"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/two_hands_and_a_tiny_house/","title":"two_hands_and_a_tiny_house"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/water/","title":"water"},{"content":"An April build update We got some walls up!\nTable Of Contents\rWhat we\u0026rsquo;ve done A timeline of sorts What\u0026rsquo;s next? What we\u0026rsquo;ve done What a hectic last few days! Erny and I took some time off to focus on the tiny house full-time over the Easter break. For us, the past week has been a rollercoaster ride of highs and lows, with the weather constantly threatening to rain on our parade. It has been a lesson in patience, and willingness to adapt and learning as we go. But we\u0026rsquo;ve soldiered on, and I\u0026rsquo;m proud to say that we\u0026rsquo;ve made some significant progress - we can\u0026rsquo;t wait to update you!\nBelow is a semi-detailed blow-by-blow breakdown of our tiny house blitz. But if you can\u0026rsquo;t be bothered - just look at the pictures! Video is coming soon but Lys needs to take a nap.\nA timeline of sorts The break started out with a wet and dreary weekend forecast, but we didn\u0026rsquo;t let that dampen our spirits. We decided to make use of the time by working in the garage and cutting wall studs. We also cleaned up the trailer of the mouldy plywood and updated the tiny house model.\nUpdating the model\nCutting studs in the garage\nThis time last year we had planned to raise the walls over the Easter break, but then Lys caught COVID and there were huge storms up and down the east coast. Our tentative first steps in 2022 fell to the wayside and moulded over in wet conditions. In 2022 we realised we were not ready so we re-grouped for 2023 Easter! It might not have been glamorous work, but it was necessary, and it felt good to be moving forward from the ghosts of 2022.\nSlightly behind schedule but still feeling optimistic - Monday was a surprise, as we woke up to no rain! Over the past 10 days, we\u0026rsquo;ve been looking hawkishly at the weather forecast every half hour or so - it hasn\u0026rsquo;t been the healthiest. Lys took advantage of the dry weather and re-applied the damp course onto the trailer. The damp course will act as a thermal bridge between the cold steel of the trailer and the plywood. We are hoping this will reduce condensation and mould underneath the house. We also set up our new (to us) second-hand 6x3 m gazebo over the trailer. This was a huge lifesaver as we could work under the gazebo, protected from the intermittent showers. The forecasted rain still held off and Lys pressed forward and constructed our subfloor while Erny continued cutting studs in the garage. Lys got some great practice with the impact driver, and it felt pretty surreal that we actually screwed pieces of wood together. Finally some tangible progress!\nConstructing the subfloor\nTuesday was another day where we were at the mercy of the rain gods, but again, they were kind to us. Lys glued the plywood down to the subfloor, and Erny continued cutting the wood for the frame. We also cut our metal strap bracing in preparation for a wall raising. In normal construction, you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t do this but we wanted to front-load as many activities as possible to maximise the good stretches of weather. Lys learnt how to use a new tool - tin-snips - thanks to a handy youtube video.\nYoutube really can teach you anything!\nWednesday was a bit of a stress-fest, as we discovered we needed an emergency bolt order from Queensland. Somehow we had forgotten that a section of the trailer steel was thinner (by 6 cm) than the other areas of the trailer - what a rookie mistake! It was a hectic half hour trying to work out what extra bolts were required (14cm and 16cm if you were curious) and making an express order with Bolt and Nut Australia. Mid-afternoon showers really slowed the great progress we had made over the last few days but managed to build our first wall! Lys made the first wall all by herself, mastering yet another tool - this time the impact driver. We are using square-headed stainless steel screws due to stainless steel\u0026rsquo;s resistance to corrosion and strength - but my goodness are they easy to strip. We must have used over 500 screws on this project so far and Lys has ruined over 15 screw headsüòû.\nShe has been binge listening to a cyber security history-based podcast called Malicious Life. It has been the perfect replacement for her true crime addiction and makes mundane tasks fly by. The stress continued into the evening with another emergency Bunnings run with Lys\u0026rsquo; brother to find nails. It turns out that we needed more special fastener connector nails and these special nails are different to the normal flat head or clout nails. It turns out that timber connector plate nails are designed and manufactured from a single piece of metal. In comparison, the shaft and head of a regular clout are manufactured separately and then joined. Because of this, the head of a regular clout may pop off a lot easier which results in a lower holding capacity. This means - even though they look exactly the same fastener connector nails are far superior (and a tad more expensive). To make matters worse we could not find the correct fastener nails in the correct dimensions. Regardless we decided to press onwards - though things were feeling a fit dire (mild exaggeration).\nWill Lys and Erny have enough connector nails?\nIn a rapid turn of events - on Thursday we finished framing our picture window wall and our tallest long wall! We were pleased with the progress, but the sporadic rain forced us to quickly rainproof our materials with tarps. Scared from the memories of the 2022 rains, Erny had this brilliant idea to make a makeshift shower screen with an old tarp to protect the trailer and our newly created walls. The good fortune continued with our bolt order coming in! Clearly, purchasing express shipping was worth every penny and now we had all the bolts we needed to bolt the subfloor and the walls to the trailer.\nWalls in progress\nThe next day was one of the most fun - our friends came around to lend a hand! We were grateful for the help of Troy, Silvia, and Jason as we framed the last wall and started drilling subfloor holes. This last wall was by far our most complex and Troy was an absolute wizard with the tape measure and Silvia took charge of cutting the last headers for our walls. Jason literally crushed putting our wall together and had sage advice when it came to the most efficient way to drill our subfloor.\nWe also made a few booboos here. It turns out the the headers in the model were the incorrect size which meant our loft windows were not perfectly aligned. Additionally Erny cut a king stud too short even though we had always measured twice before we cut. On top of this - we discovered that because of the bottom and top plates of the short walls being 45mm thick and the bottom and top plates of the long walls being 35mm our whole plan was just a little bit out of whack. How frustrating!\nBut alas we pressed on and together, Silvia and Jason made light work drilling through the subfloor and using a very blunt spade bit to make the insets for the bolt heads. Making things with friends was a rewarding experience, and building a big thing is made better with banter, laughs and collective problem-solving. Big thanks to Jason and Silvia for bringing over their gear and (perhaps more importantly ) their pizza oven for a delicious dinner! We also learned that even the best-laid plans, such as our Sketch-Up model, can differ from the reality of construction, and we had to make adjustments based on practical considerations. Delicious sausage rolls, courtesy of Troy\u0026rsquo;s partner Deborah, were a welcomed treat after a productive day.\nFriends lending a helping hand\nSilvia on the circular saw\nThere is always time for lunch ü•™\nDrilling holes\nJason on the pizza oven\nWe had a life break on Saturday but Sunday was a day of significant progress as Erny made the first full hole through the trailer, marking a significant milestone. We had made yet another stop to Bunnings to purchase an extra long drill bit to give us the best chance of drilling through over 12 cm of wood and steel. It was a great decision but it was very slow going - a solid 9 minutes per hole at top drill speed! Everyone lent a hand - drilling a hole into through the trailer steel. A huge shout out to Lys\u0026rsquo; dad who put in some serious elbow grease drilling through the steel.\nWe also decided to strap and square the walls while they were on the ground instead of when they were vertical on the trailer. This way is easier for just the two of us and allowed us to maximise all the hands we had. Remember those fastener connector nails that we couldn\u0026rsquo;t find earlier? Well, soon we would be finding out if a little 250-gram box would successfully strap 4 walls of a tiny house\u0026hellip; Somehow, we squared and strapped most of our walls, relying on tensioners to keep them square and rearranged our timeline to increase our chances of getting the walls up. Bel came to lend a hand in the afternoon, and her assistance with drilling holes helped us work faster and prepare for the wall raising on Monday. Lys brother\u0026rsquo;s chickens kept her good company pottering about the trailer while Bel drilled. It may have been because Bel brought the best snacks (nothing like some Kettles chips). You could feel the toll of the week set in a little as we were getting a little frustrated as progress was slower than anticipated.\nBel on the tiny stool drilling through the metal\nBy the time Monday rolled around again we were determined to have these walls raised, despite the chilly Autumn weather. We started the day by watching Laura Kamp for inspiration as we worked. The day did not start off well - Lys\u0026rsquo; wrist felt so sore she couldn\u0026rsquo;t hold a drill or an impact driver. We felt like we were slowing down big time and we still needed to finish drilling and bolting the subfloor down. Luckily help was on the way with our good friends Dan and Michael. Dan - also known as drill man came to our aid and absolutely obliterated (in a good way) our holes through the trailer. Forget 9 minutes per hole - Dan was finished in 5! Michael also finished hammering in the metal strapping to our final wall - and as a bonus - added stud ties to each stud. That little box of nails covered all four walls with strapping with a few nails to spareüòõ\nWith holes now drilled, we then proceeded to bolt our subfloor down. We had a scare with bolts and fasteners going missing but it turned out that they were hiding, being misplaced in a screw box. Then, with the the help of drill man Dan, we installed the perimeter floorboards onto the subfloor. We had actually originally decided to fasten the entire flooring down and insulating before we raised the walls however, to save time, we instead just put in the floorboards around the perimeter of the trailer to support the framing. It was not ideal and we will probably encounter some difficulties down the track but we really wanted to maximise the time we had working on the house.\nLys under the trailer bolting screws\nBolts are in\nAdding the perimeter floorboards to the subfloor\nIt really felt like it was all coming together! We took a break to enjoy a delicious lunch of truffle brie cheese and late-season tomatoes, a little indulgence to fuel our bodies for the hard work ahead. Then with many hands and lots of positivity, after lunch, we raised the walls! It seriously took a small village. We lifted, coordinated and maneuvered these heavy walls into position. Using extra bracing, we secured our walls to the subfloor and then ensured that everything was as square and plumb as possible. It was overwhelming to see the whole wall frame come to life, and it still felt surreal. Honestly - the walls are so much taller than we expected\u0026hellip;and it didn\u0026rsquo;t have a roof yet. Huge thanks to Dan and Michael for staying that little bit longer to put these walls up - we could not have done it without you both!\nMichael strapping the walls\nDan and Lys\u0026rsquo; dad chatting about drill bits\nCompleted walls\nThe excitement was not over, however - Erny and Lys were also mindful of an upcoming storm on Thursday that could potentially cause issues with wood swelling and mould. Water makes wood swell and that causes issues when dealing with framing if it shrinks back to normal size. There\u0026rsquo;s a fancy word for this actually - hygroscopy! High levels of lumber moisture content may also result in mould - and we can\u0026rsquo;t have that happen! Lys is frantically googling how to keep worksites as dry as possible and Erny is strategizing how we can put the roof on as quickly as possible.\nOn the last day of our Tiny House blitz, Erny took on the task of working on the roof alone with Lys being back at work. He attached the frame securely to the trailer and installed Simpson hurricane ties, which proved to be a challenging task at height. High up on the ladder he methodically worked his way around each stud, 3 meters in the air. Then he with Lys\u0026rsquo; mum, sanded into our rafters that we had made the month before. Later in the day, Lys joined after work, and together with the help of Lys\u0026rsquo; parents, we managed to get seven out of eleven roof rafters up, racing against time and impending Thursday rain. To protect the frame from said upcoming rain, we used a large gazebo tarp as a makeshift roof. It is not perfect, but it served its purpose and hopefully will keep our progress safe from the elements - watch this space!\nRoof rafters are half on\nReflecting on the past break, it\u0026rsquo;s been a whirlwind of activity. We\u0026rsquo;ve had our fair share of slip-ups and mistakes - like our emergency bolt purchase and cutting studs too short, but we\u0026rsquo;ve also learned a lot along the way. It\u0026rsquo;s been gratifying to see all of our weeks and months of prep come to fruition, and it feels like it\u0026rsquo;s all coming together. We\u0026rsquo;ve also learned the importance of working with others and how to make use of their strengths at short notice. As a duo, it\u0026rsquo;s sometimes hard to delegate and make use of multiple people, but we\u0026rsquo;ve found that when we work with friends, it\u0026rsquo;s much more enjoyable and productive. Sometimes we felt like we were rushing so we would not waste others\u0026rsquo; time but we definitely learnt to slow down and trust the process by the third day of working with friends. A huge thank you to our family who were so supportive and accommodating - thank you for keeping us fed, making sure we slept, being always on stand by and ready to lend a hand. To Silvia and Jason whose extra drills were an absolute lifesaver and Troy who provided delicious sausage rolls and buckets of positivity. A huge thank you to Bel for bringing the best snacks. Finally, mega claps to Dan and Michael who were absolute troupers, rolling their sleeves up to lift some heavy Douglas fir walls, helping us get close to making this tiny house a reality.\nLooking back on the schedule, we did not manage to achieve everything we had hoped for. Due to rain and setbacks, we ended up 2 days behind schedule and we have not dried in our house which means that we are at the mercy of the elements. We suppose that, like most things, construction and DIY take longer than we expect. However, we did not expect to come this far and seeing walls up is such a huge milestone - something truly to feel proud ofüòÑ.\nFinally, we\u0026rsquo;ve discovered the joys of using screws! They\u0026rsquo;re like a CTRL-Z button, allowing us to undo our errors and easily reuse them.\nFrame is up!\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next? Obviously we want to get to dry-in but Erny is off to Bendigo and Lys is going to have a long, long nap üò¥\nCatch ya later, Lys \u0026amp; Erny\n","href":"/themiette/posts/2023-apr-build-update/","title":"April Build Update"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/subfloor/","title":"subfloor"},{"content":"A March build update A door, some floor progress and general reflections.\nTable Of Contents\rWhat we\u0026rsquo;ve done Highlights What\u0026rsquo;s next? What we\u0026rsquo;ve done Hello from The Miette HQ! The last half of February and March has been a busy and productive month for Erny and Lys, and thanks to an unseasonably dry month on the coast we have made some great progress on the tiny.\nWe kicked off the month by refurbishing our 40-year-old door. We had been looking for a narrow external french door for a while and rescued this gem from a renovation down south. The door had quite a bit of - let us say character, but the glass was intact, the wood in great condition and the correct dimensions! We got to work sanding down the varnish and stain and this time, compared to the windows it was an absolute breeze.\nPre-sanded door\nSanded door\nIn fact, the whole door refurbishment project was finished in about three days - so much shorter than building our own windows üòÇ Erny, being the perfectionist he is, decided to route and chisel out the area of the gouge and make a little inset to fill it back up. We think it was from a dog or small animal scratching at the wall when it was hung in a previous home. Lys actually didn\u0026rsquo;t mind the gouge, but it\u0026rsquo;s interesting to see the differences in our personalities come out during these types of projects. Lys tends to prioritise efficiency and sticking to a schedule, while Erny is all about quality and is not done until it\u0026rsquo;s done to the very best of his ability, even if it takes twice as long.\nFitting the inset to fix the door gouge\nCompleted inset\nStained inset in our door\nEven though this door project was super speedy, we are however a little stuck on the lock mechanism though - it seems that since this door is a little thinner than modern doors and we will have to make a few tweaks to its dimensions for it to fit a modern lock system. Considering that we could go lockless for a little while (at least until after a wall raising), we decided to put that problem on the back burner to focus on more solvable problems.\nFinished refurbished doors - Lys swears they look different from when we first acquired them\nIn addition to the door, we also started to put together our rafter pieces using Fred\u0026rsquo;s tiny house rafter sandwich technique. This is a recommended tiny house rafter design where we sandwich plywood around the rafters and bolt it all together instead of attaching to a ridge beam. The idea here is to reduce weight while retaining a solid roof structure. We ran into a bit of a snag when we discovered that the model that we cut our rafters to was actually 10 mm short. This meant that all of our roof rafters were a little too short, and we needed to change the angle of the pieces slightly shallower to fit the to real house width.\nHighlights Despite these setbacks, there have been some really nice moments in March. It has been nice working with the whole family in the garden, cracking out some tools that Lys\u0026rsquo; parents have not touched in years (like a set of extra large drill bits) and problem-solving small hiccups together. There have also been a few late nights working out last-minute logistics - from wanting our bathroom and kitchen floors to be at the same height makes our bathroom floor very complicated to what is the most efficient permutation of our floorboards for minimum waste - but we seem to be getting there. Lys\u0026rsquo; Dad jokes that we are slowly becoming Australia\u0026rsquo;s smallest Bunnings with the variety of drill bits, screws and nails that we are collecting.\nErny\u0026rsquo;s extremely scientific plan\nWe also made great headway on the subfloor. After re-purchasing plywood (our previous purchase became mouldy last year, but that is a story for another time), Lys got these new sheets primed and painted the plywood to get it ready for construction. Meanwhile, Erny has been busy cutting down subfloor joists to size and creating a detailed map of exactly where we are going to put our black butt floorboards down.\nPriming the floor joists and plywood\nOh and how could we forget - we added another tool to our growing tool family! Erny purchased a Makita vacuum cleaner. At first glance it seems to add no direct value to the house, but it is an absolute game changer cleaning up offending wood shavings from the table and floor - our backs are super appreciative.\nIn summary, most of February and March has been focused on front-loading small jobs in preparation for our week of leave in April. The idea is to prepare as much as possible to maximise our week off. Honestly, it feels a bit like d√©j√† vu - last year we tried to raise the walls and set the foundation, but unfortunately, Lys caught COVID around this time. We\u0026rsquo;re keeping our fingers crossed that she won\u0026rsquo;t get sick again and that we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to make more progress on the house during our upcoming break - Lys is once again checking the weather every 30 minutes.\nWill it rain in April?\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next? Maybe Erny\u0026rsquo;s map of the floorboard efficiency comes to fruition?\nCatch ya later, Lys \u0026amp; Erny\nGrain is so nice in the douglas fir of our joists\n","href":"/themiette/posts/mar-2023-build-update/","title":"March Build Update"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/canberra/","title":"canberra"},{"content":"Just a short update - Lys put together a little montage of our window building journey (over 8 months in the making) and we have started tackling the doors!

What we\u0026rsquo;ve done In December last year Lys\u0026rsquo; parents gently highlighted that they want their garage back. So, with a deadline of September 30th and some wonderful sunshine we decided to nail these windows down. Honestly, we try write these blogs once a month but sometimes its difficult to encapsulate every trial and tribulation when you cannot even begin to remember them all. Over December and January we worked on the windows over the Christmas break and over 4 weekends, with each day throwing up a new challenge.\nA big moment though was nailing the glass into the finished frames. Erny hired an air compressor and a brad nail gun from our local tool library (more on this later) and we spent a good hour practicing how to effectively piece a nail into blackbutt, which consistently reminded us that it is a heavy wood that is tough to pierce through. You get a small jump scare whenever the nail goes into the wood and it is incredibly loud.\nMeasuring the beading to fit the bathroom window\nOnce Erny got the hang of it all we raced through attaching the beading and were (surprisingly) finished in no time. Nailing the beading in felt like this project is gaining a little bit of momentum, that it is actually doable, and that if we can build these we have a higher likelihood of tackling the rest of the house.\nBack to the tool library - think of this as a place where people can share tools that they may only need on a once off (or very infrequent basis). Lys discovered this community a year ago when she was determining how we were going to source our tools. Having no need or space for an air compressor and nail gun on a daily basis, we thought it would be a great option to hire these larger tools out. They even provided a bunch of spare brad nails, so we didn\u0026rsquo;t have to buy any ourselves! Our local one is the Inner West Tool Library but you can also find others up and down the east coast.\nInner West Tool Library\nThe library has pretty much everything that you need\nAnother huge moment was screwing in the hinges to attach the inner and outer frame of our awning windows. These hinges have been the most finicky and needed quite a bit of coaxing. With the way the hinges open, the top edge of the inner window frame needs to be routed so that the edge doesn\u0026rsquo;t catch on the inner frame. With great care we screwed the them in and tadaaaaa - they look amazing! We now just need to attach the latches to ensure that the internal window can remain snuggle-y closed and locked and then these are ready to be installed into some walls. The stain does not look too bad too! Finally having a full awning indow that we can open and close is unbelievably satisfying - huge kudos to Erny and his unwavering attention to detail.\nLook at those hinges\nHighlights Lys worked up the courage to use the table saw by herself for the first time! Maybe Erny now has the confidence to let her use it unsupervised? We\u0026rsquo;ll find out soon enough\u0026hellip;\nThere is something oddly satisfying when you apply weather proofing foam to seal window frames. This foam goes in between the opening glass and the frame - it is squishy and has great bounce back and sticks to almost anything and is great to apply. Lys had a lot of fun applying this during her lunch breaks.\nAnother great memory was us deciding to \u0026ldquo;risk it for the biscuit\u0026rdquo; and take our huge picture window outside to fit the glass, weather seal and bead with a Summer storm on the horizon. Even though we did get a few drops on our precious window we managed to finish the job before the light ran out and the storm came in!\nRacing against the rain and daylight to finish our picture window\nOther than that\u0026hellip;.the window frames have glass in them!\nChallenges There seems to be a big storm on the way across out state so timeline looks to be a little impacted.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next? looking forward to some doors and floors (but realistically more window work - Erny\u0026rsquo;s a perfectionist) üö™\nCatch ya later, Lys \u0026amp; Erny\n","href":"/themiette/posts/jan-2023-build-update/","title":"January Build Update"},{"content":"An November December build update Window making continues with a side of weddings, berry farms, and other sundry end of year activities.\nTable Of Contents\rWhat we\u0026rsquo;ve done Highlights Challenges What\u0026rsquo;s next? What we\u0026rsquo;ve done So while writing this blog post, Lys discovers there\u0026rsquo;s a frisbee emoji ü•è also known as the flying disc emoji - how random! Tiny house wise though - our journey continues working on our windows.\nIn November we spent most of our weekends sanding the burn marks off the blackbutt panels to get them ready for piecing. Having spent over 50 hours sanding over the course of 2 months using the orbital sander has really lost its shine, in fact the activity is nothing short of mundane. To combat sanding fatigue Erny has developed a strategy of listening to podcasts with earbuds under our earmuffs to while the time away.\nLys\u0026rsquo; brother helped out sanding down the huge picture window (big thanks!). November also saw us putting together the bathroom window (smallest) as a test run. This proved difficult as the pieces had bowed slightly and were not really sitting square. Erny decided that we needed to re-sand these pieces so they became more-square to give us the best hope of flush corners. This set us back a weekend as we worked overtime to re-sand the pieces.\nSanding sanding and more\u0026hellip;sanding\nWith the parts of the frame now square we had the arduous task of lining everything up to drill our pilot holes. With a contraption of too many clamps we raced against the sun to screw our window frames together which ended up with\u0026hellip; a fail. A piece or clamp must have shifted in the process and when Erny screwed the pieces together we could tell that our window would not fit our glass. So, over the week Lys puttied up the holes with sawdust, glue and putty for another crack at it. This time we started earlier and took our time. This ended with a beautifully square(ish) window frame!\nA successful frame\nWith that small win we continued with the loft and kitchen windows. These also proved to be challenging as these three frames open. And it was here, design wise, we hit a little snag - we did not account for the hinges in our design. Our previous design did not account for hinge movement and so part of the hinges will be exposed to the elements. So back to the drawing board we went to see how we could integrate those hinges into our windows in a weather tight manner. Luckily Erny found this video, which is not only Australian but it details where and how one should install hinges on casement (and then by extension awning) windows.\nLys also happened to purchase a secondhand router earlier on in the year which came in handy. Having learnt our lesson from previously failures we had the foresight to run a prototype to test if our in-layed hinge strategy would work as we expected - and it did! We then routed the edges off our frames to inlay the hinges into our frames. Success!\nPrototype\nEnsuring the hinges are measured correctly\nThe 2nd hand router doing its good work\nBut it would not be a build update with another hiccup. We test drove the Osmo - UV Protection Oil on some spare blackbutt. It is lovely and pulls the colour of the wood out so well. It does however make the putty quite orange, and so Lys decided we needed to stain the wood to blend the putty into the blackbutt. We settled on Sikkens Cetol BLX-Pro Teak Timber Stain which was the lightest stain Bunnings offered that would hide the orange tone. After trialing it out on our bathroom window, Lys was not convinced that it camouflaged the putty orange. Mildly distraught, Lys mulled over if we should continue down the staining path. Ultimately we decided - yes - it would be a good idea to stain the wood as an undercoat.\nTest piece highlighting the overly orange putty\nStaining the pieces to teak perfection\nFrom there we have been full steam ahead with the rest of our windows! Our big picture window frame has been completed as well as the internal window frames of all our opening windows. It shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be too long before all of them have finished by the end of January\u0026hellip; (being hopeful here).\nOur final December hurdle was a extremely scary glass fitting for our picture window. Measuring in at 1.2m x 1.5m and with a glass pane that is over 20kgs, we tentatively test fit our glass into the frame. Clearly our 2mm leeway must have been eaten up by a twist or a slight bend because the last glass fitting was tight. We will probably need to sand out the cavity in the new year.\nHighlights Lys doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to jinks it but the weather has actually been really good these last few months! Here\u0026rsquo;s hoping for a productive 2023 ü§û\nChallenges Not so much of a challenge but we\u0026rsquo;re trying to enjoy life (and the good weather while we build). Congrats to Jo and Mandi :)\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next? More windows and maybe some walls? But also, have a safe and snazzy festive season and see you in 2023 ‚≠ê\nCatch ya later, Lys \u0026amp; Erny\nOiling windows\n","href":"/themiette/posts/nov-dec-2022-build-update/","title":"November December Build Update"},{"content":"An October build update We got solar! ‚òÄÔ∏è ‚òÄÔ∏è ‚òÄÔ∏è\nTable Of Contents\rWhat we\u0026rsquo;ve done Highlights Challenges What\u0026rsquo;s next? What we\u0026rsquo;ve done One of our neighbours decided to demolish their house without removing their 10 year old solar system (it was not cost effective for them to re-install). Luckily for us they said that if we could take it down we could have it! Erny clambered onto the roof on a balmy Sunday day to bring the panels down.\nOn the shopping front we spent hours online trawling for a dealer that would sell us heavy-duty fiction awning hinges for our loft and kitchen windows. For context, we will have three awning windows in the house that open outwards from the window sill1.\nAn example of an awning window\nA friction hinge allows the opening part of the window to stay open or ajar for long periods of time2. This is handy if you want to open the window for airflow or escape from a fire (priorities aye?). Frictionless hinges would have the opening portion of the window fall back into its closed position quickly.\nBut because awning windows are currently not in fashion it was really hard to find the a vendor, and worse still - because our double glass is heavy it was virtually impossible to find options that could take the weight of the glass. We ended up going with a commercial style which is a little less than aesthetic but very sturdy.\nWe also spend way too long deciding what sort of latches we were going to use to close the windows shut and most importantly - what colour they should be. It turns out that with awning windows one can only use one type of latch. These are called wedge fasteners and Lys couldn\u0026rsquo;t - for the life of her - find a good example of how they should be installed. Luckily the lovely team at Restoration Online were so helpful and stepped Lys through all things fasteners. We opted for polished brass across all fixtures, because it looks pretty and is quite popular meaning we may be able to snag some second hand deals if some unfortunate renovator accidentally purchases the incorrect size/amount.\nIf you ever wanted to know how wedge fasteners work\nAs a side note - if you ever are in the market for fixtures (think door handles, window fixings, locks or gate hooks) there seems to be only one player in the Australian market and that is TradCo (unless you go with something particularly boutique). We only say this because all online offerings look the same. Heck - some even call the TradCo products fancy names but use the same stock photos as the TradCo online PDF pamphlet3. It\u0026rsquo;s not a bad thing but it is difficult as a consumer to compare and contrast if everything is exactly the same.\nWe also played around with the second-hand router that Lys found off facebook marketplace for a steal.\nHighlights Getting the solar panels was such a huge highlight. Erny says that compared to the current market these solar panels would be about 60% as efficient but a new suite of panels (+ installation) would be approximately $4000 so it seems unfair to compare. We also did not expect to get solar so soon - if at all - so it was a nice win. ‚òÄÔ∏è Side note: made a short vid (with gentle encouragement from a friendly social media savvy human - looking at you Lydia! üòÑ)\nChallenges We snapped a few more drill bits and need to purchase an 18v drill. Currently we have a 12v and a 9v but drilling pilot holes through the blackbutt is proving difficult. We\u0026rsquo;re also filling up a lot of our mistakes so another order of wood filler may be required.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next? Lys is desperate to finish a window.

What we\u0026rsquo;ve done We went through our stash of 90x45mm lengths and picked out roof rafters. These have been measured down to a 20 degree angle and some have been cut to size! We\u0026rsquo;ve been doing this in the garage when there has been a rain shower break and it has worked quite well. Erny created a little jig to speed up the process and it has been great get that out of the way.\nWorking in the garage cutting window rafters\nThen we spent 3 whole days stripping the faces of our cedar cladding boards. Originally, we were going to use paint stripper and scrape the old paint off but we found that method too slow. By shearing the face off the boards we can get to the beautiful grain quickly, but it does substantially decrease the thickness down from 19mm to 15mm, which is just enough to continue using the pieces as cladding. We still need to cut out to extend the tongue and grooves of each piece (there are about 70 3m pieces to fix up) but that\u0026rsquo;s a future problem. It is truly a labour of love refurbishing this cladding but we think it will be worth it! Western Red Cedar is often $30 - $40 per lineal meter as it is not grown in Australian plantations and so we are very lucky to have found some at no cost on the secondary market (good work Erny!).\nStripping western red cedar cladding\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve finally tweaked and re-tweaked our design for our custom windows. We are kind of following a process similar to Project Kamp - they made a comprehensive video about their window journey which you can watch below.\nLike Project Kamp, we are also using double glazed windows (see our post on our recent-ish trip to Canberra) but we are using Blackbutt frames. We also purchased EPDM414 self adhesive window tape from Clark Rubber to keep our windows water and air tight. Clark Rubber is this rubber and pool store in Australia that has a bright yellow platypus as its logo - Honestly Lys had never been to Clark Rubber before and it was just a random experience. Who knew that there were so many rubber products available to the retail market?\nThen our much awaited week of leave came around! We spent most of our week off machining these window frames down to size and cutting channels and beading. Honestly this was pretty slow going - measuring, cutting, re-measuring our mistakes but we are definitely closer to putting our glass into the frames.\nCutting window pieces to size\nFinished window pieces\nFeature Window (our biggest window) Pieces\nFinally, our finishing oil and putty came in the mail and Lys is excited to use some new products. We are going to protect our blackbutt frames with an product from Osmo - UV Protection Oil1. This stuff is literally the good oil - being easy to prepare, easy to apply and easy to maintain. It is also made of natural oils (sunflower oil, soya oil, thistle oil and linseed oil) and has lower amounts of volatile chemicals.\nThe only down side to this product is that we had to ship it from Queensland! It seems that there are no retailers in our state who stock this product at an affordable price\u0026hellip;\nHighlights We got another extension cord! This may not sound like much but we have been working on one singular powerpoint. Having another extension cord means that we can use (wait for it\u0026hellip;) a whopping two power tools at the same time. It\u0026rsquo;s the little things that bring joy you know?\nChallenges Our week off came with a few challenges! The few days prior Lys religiously checked the weather forecast every hour on the hour to see what our prospects were for full days of work. Luckily the forecast was more conservative than usual and we managed to get over 8 hours of work in per day.\nWe also had a few issues with our very faithful Makita table saw and tool set. We were making some cross cuts on the table saw and discovered that NOTHING was square. It turns out that the set square the we had been using was out by 1mm. This isn\u0026rsquo;t an issue when we are working on larger longer pieces (e.g cladding) but is a positive nightmare when it comes to woodworking that requires more finesse (cough the windows). To remediate, we set off for an emergency (and actually square) set square which made our lives a whole lot easier (and more accurate). We also discovered the benefits - and it sounds a little silly - to cleaning the table saw blade. We were experiencing inconvenient friction burn marks on our blackbutt wood and our friend Silvia suggested that it may be time for a new blade or a quick clean. Taking pause to maintain our tools reduced the friction burn marks and allowed us to eek a few more cuts out of the old blade.\nGot somewhat distracted by all the Makita products\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next? Australia\u0026rsquo;s Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) has officially confirmed that we are heading into yet another La Ni√±a, our 3rd consecutive wet Summer so honestly not feeling very hopeful. But slow progress is still progress so that is something.\nI am not crying about the rain are crying about the rain\nCatch ya later, Lys \u0026amp; Erny\nRead the technical specs of Osmo here\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","href":"/themiette/posts/aug-sep-2022-build-update/","title":"August September 2022 Build Update"},{"content":"Operation Find a Roof As Lys sits down to write this she can officially say that we have sourced all of our roof components! It is a mixture of second hand material and some first-hand non-negotiable(s) but it\u0026rsquo;s great to finally have all the bits and bobs.\nTable Of Contents\rThe Design The Material Gutters Sundry Items The Design We chose to have a slightly off centred gable roof for our tiny house. Technically this is known as a saltbox pitch style but we have not found that term used commonly in Australia. We wanted to keep the traditional house style compared to some of the more modern tiny house options. The style is also quite useful for maximising solar panels on a small space and this will be helpful if we decide to go off-grid. It is also simple to construct as there are minimal valleys or curves which makes it great for novice builders also known as cough us.\nOur roof design\nWe are going to have a roof pitch of 20 degrees (which is standard for most houses and easier to find second hand materials for) even though we could have as little as a 5 degree roof pitch for a gable roof. Most tiny houses choose a shed style or flat roof which is technically more space economical as one can get more internal head height but we really liked the more traditional aesthetic. There is just something so comfortable and cosy about a gable roof.\nGable, Saltbox, Flat and Shed roof styles are all common tiny house options\nThe Material Metal was our go to choice for a roof - it\u0026rsquo;s light, relatively affordable and easy to come by on the second hand market. Often larger jobs will order 10% extra as leeway and sell the remainder. We actually found our Colorbond from a lovely family fixing a shed, a elderly couple redoing a carport and a renovation on the Central Coast.\nOn our way up from the Central Coast we had this brilliant idea to cut the Colorbond panelling with tin snips to fit the sheets into the van. It turns out that it is incredibly difficult to cut corrugated iron with tin snips (think of these like scissors for metal) over long distances and most people just use a circular saw or angle grinder. Luckily we had a rope that Erny was given from another pick up and we bundled 6m pieces of Colorbond into the back of the van and tied the boot closed for a 1.5hr drive home. Note to self - always bring a circular saw!\nBut what about the colour?\nLys absolutely adores a dark coloured and black roof. It is the current tiny house trend at the moment and looks very sleek, blending into the the environment if it is particularly verdant. The building industry also loves a good dark roof as well1.\nThat being said - the colour is not the ideal colour in sunny Australia, or anywhere warm in this changing climate2. Long story short - dark coloured surfaces absorb more heat energy than lighter colours. In a roofing context this heats the roof cavity of your home and - unless you have great insulation - heats the interior of your home. On a broader scale, with urban sprawl suburbs can fall victim to the Urban Heat Island3 effect - where urban centers are significantly warmer than rural areas due to having less trees and more dark surfaces.\nAt one point in time Australian states were looking to ban dark coloured roofs on new developments.\nHaving said this - a tiny house roof is very small so in the grand scheme of things it probably won\u0026rsquo;t matter, but as Australia\u0026rsquo;s cities experience more urban sprawl it is more important than ever to make small steps to heat-proof abodes - and this means Lys must sacrifice her dark coloured roof.\nSo we are going with Surf Mist as our roof colour! Solar Absorptance (SA) is the proportion of the total incident solar radiation that is absorbed by the roofing material (the remainder is reflected) and a roof with a lower solar absorptance will absorb less heat than a roof with a higher solar absorptance. Theoretically, this should keep the roof space and building cooler on a hot day.\nSurfmist has a SA of 0.32 - compared to Monument (an incredibly popular tiny house roof colour) which has a SA of 0.71. Obviously if we had our time again we\u0026rsquo;d love to use Whitehaven or Dover White (SA of 0.23) but it seems like it is not available for retail consumers, rather it is an architectural offering only.\nClassic Colorbond Colours\nGutters We found the gutters in the Haberfield of all places. A heritage listed house had accidentally ordered the incorrect gutter type in the colour that we were looking for (Surfmist) and we pounced. We ended up getting them for free as well üòÑ We actually ended up using the same rope to secure our gutters in the van - we suppose the real take away here is always bring a rope when picking up second hand construction items.\nTaking off gutters\nSundry Items It was most difficult trying to find flashing, ridge caps and rivets second hand. We ended up purchasing on the first-hand market (and rust is a thing so we thought this would be the best approach). This posed another problem as most suppliers are not interested in servicing such a small job or they are a full service fit out (i.e. they provide the product and the installation service). Other vendors wouldn\u0026rsquo;t match the existing gutters that we had or were not based in our state - shipping costs are a killer! Additionally, with rising construction costs website prices were inflated from 5% - 20% on the personalized quote.\nLuckily we found Jack from Roofit Online which had an online store (because as we know Millennials avoid talking on the phone like the plague) and 24/7 customer service. They specialise in Colorbond and locally manufacture. What they can\u0026rsquo;t make they source though their team based in NSW as well.They also take all types of jobs no matter how small which is great when building a tiny house. Jack was super patient and chucked a 5% discount - thanks Jack! We only have good things to say.\nSo here we are - one nerdy rant later about roof colours and we are a little bit closer to putting ours up!\nCatch ya later, Lys \u0026amp; Erny\nFind out why people like dark roofs with Renew\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nIf you feel extra nerdy Lys found this paper on roof performance around the world a great read\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nUrban Heat Island Effect is a term used to describe the outer suburbs of major cities with minimal tree cover.

We had been on the hunt for double glazed glass closer to home but it seems that Canberra - having cold winters - has great reclaimed glass options.\nTable Of Contents\rIntroducing Handyman Trading Post A side step antiquing So what\u0026rsquo;d you get? But why use double glazing?\nWeight is a huge issue in tiny house construction (we need to keep the building under 4.5 tonnes) and double glazed glass is notoriously heavy. This is fine for a traditional build but for tiny house construction builders often choose to install single paned glass. We chose double paned glass because firstly, Erny wanted this feature, but also because our windows will take a good percentage of our wall surface area. We\u0026rsquo;re also trying out a continuous band of insulation on top of insulation batting to reduce thermal bridging in light of Passive House design so it would be a pity to have insulated walls but have all our heat leak out of our windows. We\u0026rsquo;re also not planning on adding active heating mechanisms (e.g air-con) to the Miette if we have to so choosing double glazed windows seems like a good way to go for now.\nIntroducing Handyman Trading Post Handymans Trading Post specialises in used building materials and seems to be the only place that sells double glazed glass on the east coast. Erny found them on Facebook Marketplace and they were super friendly online. They recommended that we pop down in person to see their panes and even though they were in another state the trip was well worth it.\nThe Handyman Trading Post\nWindows everywhere!\nWhen we went in January, they had some great stock (which is what you get from over 41 years in business). They seem to have Australia\u0026rsquo;s collection cedar doors and window frames and some of the nicest stained glass windows too. You can find more about Handyman Trading Post here.\nCanberra has the best stock\nNote: they close at 1PM on Saturdays so if you are traveling from afar, factor this in! We arrived at 12:30 - just in time to pick up our glass.\nA side step antiquing There\u0026rsquo;s also a cute antique store named Down Memory Lane which is just opposite so we spent some time there checking out the wares. The stock seems so much cheaper than up North and the furniture was in top quality. Definitely recommend a looksee.\nCanberra has the best stock\nSo what\u0026rsquo;d you get? So after months of looking we have our double glazed glass for our custom windows!\nOur picture window is a generous 1400 x 1100mm and will be our main feature. It\u0026rsquo;s currently residing in Lys\u0026rsquo; office covered by a towel. Our kitchen window pane is a little larger than we anticipated coming in at (470x1200mm). We\u0026rsquo;ll have to manipulate our walls to fit this window into our design. We lucked out with our bathroom window as there was only a small selection of frosted glass options but we came away with a thin long window which we should be able to put frosted film on.\nFinally, we were super lucky to get two panes exactly the same dimensions for our loft windows (at 300x900mm)!\nCatch ya later, Lys \u0026amp; Erny\nArrive early if you\u0026rsquo;re traveling far\n","href":"/themiette/posts/a-quick-trip-to-canberra/","title":"A Quick Trip to Canberra"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/blackbutt/","title":"blackbutt"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/douglas_fir/","title":"douglas_fir"},{"content":"A June build update Decided that we should do monthly build updates as we march towards the end of the year. We\u0026rsquo;re hoping to reach lock up by then (walls, floor and roof complete) and 31st December is our D-day.\nTable Of Contents\rWhat we\u0026rsquo;ve done Challenges What\u0026rsquo;s next? What we\u0026rsquo;ve done Erny bought a second hand table saw for $400 a few months back and it\u0026rsquo;s been an absolute workhorse. With it we\u0026rsquo;ve milled our wood down to size (70x45mm) for our walls and have started cutting down the blackbutt for our window frames.\nWorking with a job site table (one that\u0026rsquo;s portable) saw has meant there have been a few tweaks that we\u0026rsquo;ve had to make. The first is that the vibrations and when one rips though a particularly long length of wood the fence is prone to shifting. Erny hacked a wood piece to clamp on to the table saw to minimise this.\nMilling douglas fir to size\nAnother is that the vibrations move the table saw forward on the table that we\u0026rsquo;re using. Once again clamps come to our rescue as we decided to clamp down two pieces of wood to the end of the table. These act as a stopper to stop the table saw shifting.\nCutting blackbutt to size\nSomething else that we\u0026rsquo;ve noticed is how good douglas fir smells. Apparently it smells like citrus but it just smells really fragrant. And as a soft wood it\u0026rsquo;s super light! Douglas fir is considered one of the most resilient softwoods in the commercial market and can handle really hard conditions. You\u0026rsquo;ll find it in older style houses or in large beams. Apparently, it was the go-to wood in the 19th century and was milled in all over Sydney. Now, apparently, Australia goes for treated pine for its lumber material as its quicker to grow and Douglas fir is less available. Our lumber comes from a timber mill that was closing down to make way for apartments and off cuts from a housing renovation.\nBlackbutt is our wood of choice to frame our windows with Erny having the bright idea to make the window frames himself. It\u0026rsquo;s a ridiculously heavy native hardwood that has a gorgeous grain and colour. We picked up the planks at an auction house to save them from getting mulched as they have quite a few cracks and burls in them (or as some people like to say - character). It also smells different to the Douglas fir when it gets sawn - because it\u0026rsquo;s a hardwood. Since Blackbutt is so dense it causes the blade to heat up due to increased friction. This burns the wood and brings out a more burnt smell.\nWood Density Notes Douglas Fir 550kg/m3 Softwood Blackbutt 900kg/m3 Hardwood Also, we\u0026rsquo;re following part of the Unified Construction Method by Fred Schultz, by creating ply connectors for our roof rafters and have measured 23 of these out. Lys had to hunt high and low for a protractor that hadn\u0026rsquo;t been touched since Year 6 Maths.\nChallenges We\u0026rsquo;ve had a string of pretty good weekends in June so can\u0026rsquo;t complain about the weather! ‚òÄÔ∏èüåßÔ∏è A thing we\u0026rsquo;re trying to tweak at the moment is finding fastest and most optimal way to set up our workspace since we\u0026rsquo;re working outside.
