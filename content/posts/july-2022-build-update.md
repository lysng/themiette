### A July build update

What have we done? Absolutely nothing. Lys honestly thinks it's been the wettest July that we've lived through in sunny Australia.

{{< toc >}}

#### What we've done
Erny jetted off to the US for a few weeks to play ultimate frisbee! Left to her own devices Lys did a few sundry things like source suppliers for our metal connectors. We've also added a few new features to the site - now you can add comments and now subscribe if you feel so inclined. Is Lys using this project to learn some coding skills on the side? Maybe...üëÄ

We've also got a new [Resources Page](https://lysng.github.io/themiette/resources/) up so hopefully if there's anyone else out there who's crazy enough to build their own shed/tiny house/trailer/van thing they'll have an easier time of it than we did :smile:   

#### Challenges
üåßÔ∏è

#### What's next?
Fingers crossed this rain goes away so we can prep our walls for assembly in August! Maybe we'll end up finalising our roof...who knows really. We're going to take a week off in September to pull up the walls, roof and walls so no pressure!

Catch ya later,
Lys & Erny
