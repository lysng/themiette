### A July build update

What have we done? Absolutely nothing. Lys honestly thinks it's been the wettest July that we've lived through in sunny Australia.

{{< toc >}}

#### What we've done
Erny jetted off to the US for a few weeks to play ultimate frisbee! Left to her own devices Lys did a few sundry things like order roofing materials and source suppliers for our metal connectors. We also wrote up some more content so hopefully a new post every...fortnight? We've also got a new Resources Page up so hopefully if there's anyone else out there who's crazy enough to build their own shed/tiny house/trailer/van thing they'll have an easier time of it than we did :smile:   

#### Challenges
🌧️

#### What's next?
Fingers crossed this rain goes away so we can prep our walls for assembly in August! We took a week off in September to pull up the walls, roof and walls so no pressure!

Catch ya later,
Lys & Erny
