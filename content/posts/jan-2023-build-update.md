### A January build update
We get glass in window frames.

{{< toc >}}

#### What we've done
In December last year Lys' parents gently highlighted that they want their garage back. So, with a deadline of September 30th and some wonderful sunshine we decided to nail these windows down. Honestly, we try write these blogs once a month but sometimes its difficult to encapsulate every trial and tribulation when you cannot even begin to remember them all. Over December and January we worked on the windows over the Christmas break and over 4 weekends, with each day throwing up a new challenge. 

A big moment though was nailing the glass into the finished frames. Erny hired an air compressor and a finishing nail gun from our local tool library (more on this later) and we spent hours practicing how to effectively piece a nail into blackbutt, which consistently reminds us on a daily basis that it is a heavy wood that is difficult to work with. You get a small jump scare whenever the nail goes into the wood and it is incredibly loud. 

Once Erny got the hang of it all we raced through attaching the beading and were (surprisingly) finished in no time. Nailing the beading in really felt like this project is gaining a little bit of momentum, that it is actually doable, and that if we can build these we have a higher likelihood of tackling the rest of the house. 
 

#### Highlights
Window frames have glass in them! 

#### Challenges
There's a big storm on the way...

#### What's next?
looking forward to some doors and floors (but realistically more window work - Erny's a perfectionist) ðŸšª

Catch ya later,
Lys & Erny
