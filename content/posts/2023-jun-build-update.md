### A June build update
A lot of shopping and finally finishing sanding the cladding!

{{< toc >}}

#### What we've done
The tail end of May and the month of June have been quite eventful, filled with a lot of shopping and unexpected visitors from far away states. Let's dive right in!

Our fanciest acquisition was a package of flathead brass screws that arrived in the mail.  While elegant in appearance, they present a formidable challenge due to their soft composition and that flatheads are known for slipping and causing drills to gouge the timber. Every person that Lys shares this purchase with is flabbergasted on the screw choice - why pick something so challenging to work with? It turns out that inspiration can strike at any moment, and Lys found hers while passing through a fancy neighbourhood. She spotted a garage door adorned with western red cedar facing and beautiful brass nails. The sight left a lasting impression, but clearly Lys didn't realise exactly what she was getting into...we will see how we fare.

Decking oil also made its way to our doorstep (all the way from Western Australia), and we wasted no time in starting the oiling process. The product we chose is CUTEK® Extreme CD50, a high-performance, oil-based wood stabiliser with a self-healing effect. This Australian-made solution penetrates deeply into the timber, highlighting its natural grain and beauty while providing robust and long-lasting protection. It is quite nice to use a product built for the harsh Australian climate, but we're trying out a few different oils on this build - it'll be interesting to see how they age and weather over time.

However, using CUTEK® Extreme CD50 comes with its own challenges. The rough sawn surface of our wood eagerly absorbs the oil, making it quite the thirsty endeavour. Additionally - it's there has been a cold snap and the oil is taking much longer to penetrate and dry.

To expedite the process and make use of the good weather (read - lack of rain), we enlisted the help of Lys' brother, Tom, who proved to be an absolute champion at oiling duty. Having an extra pair of hands certainly makes the work fly by, and we're grateful for his assistance.

Finally, our more practical purchase (in an attempt to prepare for the next phase of our project) was dampcourse and flashing tape to flash and waterproof our windows. This will be crucial when the time comes to install them.

Once again we've been inspired by Two Hands and A Tiny House with his flashing techniques. Lys has lost count how many times we've paused, played and repeated that video. We have also found these great videos by the Australian Glass and Window Association - the demonstrations are extremely clear and quite detailed.

June also saw some unexpected and helpful visitors! Our team expanded further with the dedication of Bel, Silvia, Lys, and Lys' mother, who spent many weekends sanding cedar weatherboards to the correct grit for installation. Together we refurbished and refreshed over 200 lineal meters of cladding starting from 80 grit to then 100 grit and then finally 120 grit. Huge thanks to their hard work and attention to detail.

On the logistical front but still in the shopping haul theme, Erny took charge of getting quotes for a missing piece of our skylights. It was a huge relief to discover that the cost would be less than $150, making it a worthwhile investment to give our skylights a new lease on life. We're excited to kick off the roof construction in July, and these skylights will undoubtedly be a fantastic addition. As we progress, - we've become aware of potential shortages in decking screws. It's a reminder to always stay one step ahead and ensure we have an adequate supply of essential materials. Playing to his strengths, Erny estimated the remaining wood we have for the battens, internal wall, and loft sections. Luckily, it seems like we have just enough to complete these crucial elements without any delays or the need to purchase additional materials.

Amidst the hard work, we've also made time for celebrations and cherished moments. Zy travelled all the way from Alice Springs on her birthday weekend to lend a hand with sanding and spend time with our chickens (pesky Agatha, Bertha and Clementine). Happy belated birthday, Zy!

#### What's next?
As we venture into new territory, we're currently strategising on how to install our windows. It's a significant milestone that will transform our tiny house into a cosy and light-filled space. We're researching different techniques, seeking advice from everywhere we can get it (thank you very much AGWA), and drawing on our own creativity to ensure the windows are installed in some shape and form. That's it for now -  June has been a month of challenges, inspiration, and progress. We appreciate everyone's continued support and can't wait to share more updates soon. 

Catch ya later,
Lys & Erny
