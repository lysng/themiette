### Hello World :wave:

My name is Lys and my partner Erny and I are building a tiny home made out of seconds, reclaimed and recycled materials. This is a small space on the interwebs to to document our progress and share our photos for anyone who would like to follow our journey! :smile:

{{< toc >}}

#### Why build a tiny house?
Erny and I have always been interested in living more sustainably and living small. Then a pandemic hit and it seemed like a good idea to get started on making the dream a reality. 

#### Do you have any constraints?
We're trying to do everything (bar trailer, electrical and plumbing) ourselves.

Other constraints include:
- Buying second hand or borrowing tools (from tool libraries and benevolent friends)
- Going for second, reclaimed and recycled materials first (thank you Facebook marketplace :heart:)
- Having limited construction knowledge (however we have some amazing friends who do!)
- Working full time jobs with no plans on quitting them

We're also following the building principles of [Fred's Tiny Houses](https://fredstinyhouses.com.au/) and his Unified Construction Method and [Passive Haus Design principles](https://www.yourhome.gov.au/passive-design/passive-house).

#### What does miette mean?

Miette is the french word for crumb or morsel. We chose it as we share a love of pastries, bread and all things that create tiny dust carbs but also because crumbs (like our budget) are small - like our tiny house! We also love the colour yellow - you'll often see Erny running about in a yellow raincoat.

Other names that we bounced around included:
- Le petit chou (the little cabbage)
- Wanda Inn
- The Blue Elephant
- Half Bark House
- Block House (after our favourite climbing gym)

#### So how's it going? 
It's going very slooooooooooooooowly. We've bought the trailer and have now milled our wood but Covid, La Niña and general life have really halted our progress. 

Catch ya later,
Lys & Erny
