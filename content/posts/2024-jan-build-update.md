### Our first update for 2024!
2024 has well and truly started with what feels like a huge January. Among the noteworthy developments was new eye protection! But jokes aside, we got some new eye-glasses from Bunnings and these are crystal clear with exceptional comfort, with Erny forgetting that they’re even on his face or on his head. They have swiftly become an indispensable asset — and it’s the little things, you know?

#### Painting is harder than it looks...
January saw us pick up some brushes to get our painting on. The seemingly straightforward task revealed intricacies involving precise cutting and meticulous brushwork. The entrance of Lys' father (who painted to earn pocket money in his youth), who gave us some tips, making the whole endeavour less painful. We learnt that Erny is not very handy with a brush (he’s got to have some fatal flaws somewhere), so Lys and her father did most of the painting. It’s honestly magical what a coat of paint can do, and it really ties the entire house together.

January saw us facing our fears — working on the door frame. Lys cut into the subfloor to make way for the door frame, while Erny set about planning what said door frame should look like. We had help though with special guests Jo and Mandi joined forces for a productive session, contributing to the installation of final battens and the cladding divider for our fourth wall. This meant that Erny and Lys could focus on the door frame pieces while still progressing on the wall preparation.

#### New Makita tools!
We also welcomed a new member to our Makita family! Erny's adeptness in uncovering hidden gems on Facebook Marketplace manifested in the acquisition of a compound saw (drop saw) at a fraction of its retail price. He snapped up a huge compound saw for only $130! That is an actual steal. The cutting blade was even bigger than what we had hoped for, and it has already proved its usefulness. We decided (against our better judgement, but also it was the only solution) that we would install the cedar cladding diagonally for design contrast. This meant that each piece required several 45 degree cuts before installation. Within the first few days, we cut angle after angle using the new saw. While the installation is much slower, no one can deny that the diagonal cladding looks extremely stylish and really highlights the cedar wood grain.

The Australian Open saw us slightly distracted, with us ending our days glued to the TV watching a lot of tennis (inevitably making morning wake-ups difficult). But what was more challenging was the 36-degree heatwave made its presence felt in late January, impacting progress. Erny persevered, working on demanding diagonal 45-degree cuts amid the oppressive heat, whilst Lys suffered migraines. Bel popped by to lend a hand, but really the lesson here is: do not work through a heatwave over 30 degrees. 

#### What's next?
Currently, Erny’s at a Frisbee tournament (a well deserved break) providing Lys with the opportunity to put together a short video. It’s a little throwback to April 2023 where some of our friends popped by to help raise the walls. It’s nice to reminisce and reflect on the whole journey, so hope you check it out if you have a spare 10 minutes.

Catch ya later,
Lys & Erny
