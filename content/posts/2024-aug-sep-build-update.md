Hello with another build update. Here we meet and say farewell to August and September ‚Äî as usual, time escapes us. One moment we were just getting into the rhythm of things, and the next, we were wrapped up in the chaos of the month with everything bleeding into September. Our friends got married, we went up north and we enjoyed concerts but perhaps the biggest distraction ‚Äî and a speedy luxury ‚Äî was the opening of the new Metro in our area! It‚Äôs a bit trivial, but it cuts the commute time by 50% and allows us to fit in more life into our days. Lys has been a bit of slack on the documenting of tiny house moments recently in the pursuit of finishing things, but August saw us finish our storage loft!

#### The Storage Loft
Before making the storage loft we had the bright idea to put a vapour barrier in between our internal cladding and our insulation. The idea here is to protect the insulation from getting wet as much as possible and controlling vapour moving through the walls. We decided to use some Ametalin 1500mm x 30m SilverSark as it's affordable. It was weird covering up all the insulation and all of the electrical. The whole house now looks the insides of a blue whale üêã.

For the storage loft to end all storage lofts, we used the last of our good Douglas fir and the remnants of our blackbutt floorboards. It felt bittersweet in a way, using the final pieces of wood that have been such a big part of the build. Even though we‚Äôre running low on high-quality wood, Erny is always very proud that we aren‚Äôt letting any of it go to waste. Compared to the sleeping loft and the floorboards, the storage loft was installed very quickly ‚Äî in just a day. It has already proved itself to be a very practical area as well ‚Äî now we store our extra insulation and lightweight material off the ground and having these bulky items out of the way has allowed us to bring more items in‚Ä¶üòÖJokes aside, the new loft is helping us keep the main living area clear for the remaining construction work.

#### Internal Wall Cladding
September began with a much-needed break from building as we headed to Brisbane to watch the Ultimate Frisbee Championships. After weeks of being hunched over tools and in front of the computer at work, it felt great to watch the games and enjoy the high-energy atmosphere of high level competitive sport. Team USA totally crushed the tournament, taking a clean sweep in all divisions, but it was great to see our Australian teams (Firetails and Dingoes) snag third place in both the women‚Äôs and open divisions. Huge congratulations to Rosa ‚Äî who was playing on the Firetails!

One of the first things we did after returning was to fill the air gaps around the windows. We used White Gap Filler Rod and insulation ‚Äî a trick we picked up from Scott Brown‚Äôs carpentry videos.

It's super satisfying putting the foam in the gaps and making everything weatherproof. As an aside, we have really been appreciating Scott's videos and if you are in the mood for some relatable renovation comedy his video on an `unfinished house` is both depressing and hilarious!

Then onto the task that will no doubt take the longest -  we started installing the plywood to clad our internal walls. This was and has been an extremely slow process, and we found ourselves making little progress weekend after weekend. It's just really fiddly work - one needs to measure the piece to size, nothing is square so we need to cut custom angles and dimensions, we need to cut out holes perfectly to fit cables etc. etc.

Nothing (and we mean nothing)  is quite level, which means every piece of plywood has to be hand-cut to fit. It‚Äôs a slow, meticulous process, but Lys has been getting better and better at using the circular saw. The cuts are cleaner, quicker, and more precise with each new piece.

Even disregarding the practical challenges, we are starting to make cosmetic compromises along the way, which has made the progress feel both frustrating and freeing. In typical ‚ÄúGrand Designs‚Äù fashion, we have hit the part where it feels like we‚Äôre running out of time, and while we haven‚Äôt run out of money (yet!), the pressure to finish is real (though self-inflicted). Lys is waiting for Kevin McCloud to pop out from around the corner with a zingy one-liner. One of the compromises that we have laboured over is using visible screws to install the plywood. It‚Äôs not the most polished look, but it‚Äôs a compromise we can live with for now. As Lys‚Äô friend Hugh said, it gives the place a ‚ÄúScandinavian industrial chic‚Äù vibe, and we‚Äôve decided to roll with that. Plus, it has its own kind of charm, and maybe in time, we‚Äôll come to love the exposed screws.

As September progressed, we found ourselves in the ever familiar battle with the weather. It seems to be heating up quite a bit and on days like these we politely call the tiny house the `Hot Box`. On the bright side, the skylights have been a lifesaver. Not only do they let in a ton of natural light, but they‚Äôve also provided much-needed airflow on the days when the weather does cooperate. The space heats up quickly, so having those skylights open makes a world of difference. One final thing that we promise to do but never do is more filming and writing! Honestly, it‚Äôs hard to keep track of documenting the process when we are so focused on just getting things done. We know it‚Äôs good to reflect, but actually doing the work brings us closer to completion, so it‚Äôs a fine balance.

Looking ahead, we‚Äôre racing against the clock (see our Grand Designs crisis from above). We‚Äôve crunched the numbers and, if everything goes according to plan, we‚Äôve got about 30 full working days left to bring this tiny house to fruition by the end of the year. It‚Äôs a daunting task, but not impossible. There‚Äôs still the matter of engaging a plumber, which has been hanging over our heads for a while now. It‚Äôs one of those things we keep pushing back, but we know we need to get it sorted soon. For now, though, we‚Äôre celebrating the small wins. We‚Äôve finished insulating the walls and ceiling, the wiring is in place, and the house is starting to feel more like a home with every passing day. With any luck ‚Äî and a bit of persistence ‚Äî we‚Äôll cross the finish line by December (and that‚Äôs what we say every year).
