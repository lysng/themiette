      <description>Oh, heyyyy long time no see&amp;hellip;it‚Äôs been a little while since we‚Äôve updated you all ‚Äî five months, to be exact! Between travelling, working, and chipping away at the house, the blog has definitely fallen to the wayside, but we‚Äôre back with plenty to share. Let‚Äôs dive into what‚Äôs been keeping us busy over the past few months. Spoiler alert: we‚Äôve made progress, but as usual our timeline has been blown out of the window.</description>

      <description>Happy 2025! We hope you&amp;rsquo;ve had a restful festive season üéÑüéâ. Time doesn‚Äôt just fly ‚Äî it seems to sprint when you‚Äôre building a tiny house. Going to pack updates for October, November, and December in this build update, there‚Äôs been a lot more construction than reflection and writing. But, as we reminisce on the past three months, it‚Äôs clear how much we‚Äôve accomplished, as we continue to chip away at our goals.</description>

      <description>Hello with another build update. Here we meet and say farewell to August and September ‚Äî as usual, time escapes us. One moment we were just getting into the rhythm of things, and the next, we were wrapped up in the chaos of the month with everything bleeding into September. Our friends got married, we went up north and we enjoyed concerts but perhaps the biggest distraction ‚Äî and a speedy luxury ‚Äî was the opening of the new Metro in our area!</description>

      <description>Hello! It‚Äôs another double month build update, not by design but by necessity as we have been working hard to make this tiny house more of a reality. June saw us work on our kitchen cabinets while we wait for the professionals and buying an HRV system, and July saw us getting all our insulation done! We watched many hours of Tour de France and as Lys writes this the Olympics is on in the background, so we are feeling very inspired watching others achieve their goals.</description>

But jokes aside, we got some new eye-glasses from Bunnings and these are crystal clear with exceptional comfort, with Erny forgetting that they‚Äôre even on his face or on his head. They have swiftly become an indispensable asset ‚Äî and it‚Äôs the little things, you know?</description>

Buckle up, because we&amp;rsquo;ve got quite the adventure to share!
What we&amp;rsquo;ve done As we kicked off August, we found ourselves juggling two passions: our relentless dedication to our tiny house project (read as: desperation to finish the roof before we leave for the US) and the thrilling tension of the Women&amp;rsquo;s World Cup (go the Matildas!</description>

We began with the bathroom window, which we thought would be a breeze. However, not even one window down we faced our first hiccup - it turns out the width of the window frame was not wide enough to run flush with the internal lining of the tiny house (on the inside) and flush with the exterior cladding on the outside.</description>
