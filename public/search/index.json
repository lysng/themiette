What we\u0026rsquo;ve done In December last year Lys\u0026rsquo; parents gently highlighted that they want their garage back. So, with a deadline of September 30th and some wonderful sunshine we decided to nail these windows down. Honestly, we try write these blogs once a month but sometimes its difficult to encapsulate every trial and tribulation when you cannot even begin to remember them all. Over December and January we worked on the windows over the Christmas break and over 4 weekends, with each day throwing up a new challenge.\nA big moment though was nailing the glass into the finished frames. Erny hired an air compressor and a brad nail gun from our local tool library (more on this later) and we spent a good hour practicing how to effectively piece a nail into blackbutt, which consistently reminded us that it is a heavy wood that is tough to pierce through. You get a small jump scare whenever the nail goes into the wood and it is incredibly loud.\nMeasuring the beading to fit the bathroom window\nOnce Erny got the hang of it all we raced through attaching the beading and were (surprisingly) finished in no time. Nailing the beading in felt like this project is gaining a little bit of momentum, that it is actually doable, and that if we can build these we have a higher likelihood of tackling the rest of the house.\nBack to the tool library - think of this as a place where people can share tools that they may only need on a once off (or very infrequent basis). Lys discovered this community a year ago when she was determining how we were going to source our tools. Having no need or space for an air compressor and nail gun on a daily basis, we thought it would be a great option to hire these larger tools out. They even provided a bunch of spare brad nails, so we didn\u0026rsquo;t have to buy any ourselves! Our local one is the Inner West Tool Library but you can also find others up and down the east coast.\nInner West Tool Library\nThe library has pretty much everything that you need\nAnother huge moment was screwing in the hinges to attach the inner and outer frame of our awning windows. These hinges have been the most finicky and needed quite a bit of coaxing. With the way the hinges open, the top edge of the inner window frame needs to be routed so that the edge doesn\u0026rsquo;t catch on the inner frame. With great care we screwed the them in and tadaaaaa - they look amazing! We now just need to attach the latches to ensure that the internal window can remain snuggle-y closed and locked and then these are ready to be installed into some walls. The stain does not look too bad too! Finally having a full awning indow that we can open and close is unbelievably satisfying - huge kudos to Erny and his unwavering attention to detail.\nLook at those hinges\nHighlights Lys worked up the courage to use the table saw by herself for the first time! Maybe Erny now has the confidence to let her use it unsupervised? We\u0026rsquo;ll find out soon enough\u0026hellip;\nThere is something oddly satisfying when you apply weather proofing foam to seal window frames. This foam goes in between the opening glass and the frame - it is squishy and has great bounce back and sticks to almost anything and is great to apply. Lys had a lot of fun applying this during her lunch breaks.\nAnother great memory was us deciding to \u0026ldquo;risk it for the biscuit\u0026rdquo; and take our huge picture window outside to fit the glass, weather seal and bead with a Summer storm on the horizon. Even though we did get a few drops on our precious window we managed to finish the job before the light ran out and the storm came in!\nRacing against the rain and daylight to finish our picture window\nOther than that\u0026hellip;.the window frames have glass in them!\nChallenges There seems to be a big storm on the way across out state so timeline looks to be a little impacted.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next? looking forward to some doors and floors (but realistically more window work - Erny\u0026rsquo;s a perfectionist) 🚪\nCatch ya later, Lys \u0026amp; Erny\n","href":"/themiette/posts/jan-2023-build-update/","title":"January Build Update"},{"content":"An November December build update Window making continues with a side of weddings, berry farms, and other sundry end of year activities.\nTable Of Contents\rWhat we\u0026rsquo;ve done Highlights Challenges What\u0026rsquo;s next? What we\u0026rsquo;ve done So while writing this blog post, Lys discovers there\u0026rsquo;s a frisbee emoji 🥏 also known as the flying disc emoji - how random! Tiny house wise though - our journey continues working on our windows.\nIn November we spent most of our weekends sanding the burn marks off the blackbutt panels to get them ready for piecing. Having spent over 50 hours sanding over the course of 2 months using the orbital sander has really lost its shine, in fact the activity is nothing short of mundane. To combat sanding fatigue Erny has developed a strategy of listening to podcasts with earbuds under our earmuffs to while the time away.\nLys\u0026rsquo; brother helped out sanding down the huge picture window (big thanks!). November also saw us putting together the bathroom window (smallest) as a test run. This proved difficult as the pieces had bowed slightly and were not really sitting square. Erny decided that we needed to re-sand these pieces so they became more-square to give us the best hope of flush corners. This set us back a weekend as we worked overtime to re-sand the pieces.\nSanding sanding and more\u0026hellip;sanding\nWith the parts of the frame now square we had the arduous task of lining everything up to drill our pilot holes. With a contraption of too many clamps we raced against the sun to screw our window frames together which ended up with\u0026hellip; a fail. A piece or clamp must have shifted in the process and when Erny screwed the pieces together we could tell that our window would not fit our glass. So, over the week Lys puttied up the holes with sawdust, glue and putty for another crack at it. This time we started earlier and took our time. This ended with a beautifully square(ish) window frame!\nA successful frame\nWith that small win we continued with the loft and kitchen windows. These also proved to be challenging as these three frames open. And it was here, design wise, we hit a little snag - we did not account for the hinges in our design. Our previous design did not account for hinge movement and so part of the hinges will be exposed to the elements. So back to the drawing board we went to see how we could integrate those hinges into our windows in a weather tight manner. Luckily Erny found this video, which is not only Australian but it details where and how one should install hinges on casement (and then by extension awning) windows.\nLys also happened to purchase a secondhand router earlier on in the year which came in handy. Having learnt our lesson from previously failures we had the foresight to run a prototype to test if our in-layed hinge strategy would work as we expected - and it did! We then routed the edges off our frames to inlay the hinges into our frames. Success!\nPrototype\nEnsuring the hinges are measured correctly\nThe 2nd hand router doing its good work\nBut it would not be a build update with another hiccup. We test drove the Osmo - UV Protection Oil on some spare blackbutt. It is lovely and pulls the colour of the wood out so well. It does however make the putty quite orange, and so Lys decided we needed to stain the wood to blend the putty into the blackbutt. We settled on Sikkens Cetol BLX-Pro Teak Timber Stain which was the lightest stain Bunnings offered that would hide the orange tone. After trialing it out on our bathroom window, Lys was not convinced that it camouflaged the putty orange. Mildly distraught, Lys mulled over if we should continue down the staining path. Ultimately we decided - yes - it would be a good idea to stain the wood as an undercoat.\nTest piece highlighting the overly orange putty\nStaining the pieces to teak perfection\nFrom there we have been full steam ahead with the rest of our windows! Our big picture window frame has been completed as well as the internal window frames of all our opening windows. It shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be too long before all of them have finished by the end of January\u0026hellip; (being hopeful here).\nOur final December hurdle was a extremely scary glass fitting for our picture window. Measuring in at 1.2m x 1.5m and with a glass pane that is over 20kgs, we tentatively test fit our glass into the frame. Clearly our 2mm leeway must have been eaten up by a twist or a slight bend because the last glass fitting was tight. We will probably need to sand out the cavity in the new year.\nHighlights Lys doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to jinks it but the weather has actually been really good these last few months! Here\u0026rsquo;s hoping for a productive 2023 🤞\nChallenges Not so much of a challenge but we\u0026rsquo;re trying to enjoy life (and the good weather while we build). Congrats to Jo and Mandi :)\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next? More windows and maybe some walls? But also, have a safe and snazzy festive season and see you in 2023 ⭐\nCatch ya later, Lys \u0026amp; Erny\nOiling windows\n","href":"/themiette/posts/nov-dec-2022-build-update/","title":"November December Build Update"},{"content":"An October build update We got solar! ☀️ ☀️ ☀️\nTable Of Contents\rWhat we\u0026rsquo;ve done Highlights Challenges What\u0026rsquo;s next? What we\u0026rsquo;ve done One of our neighbours decided to demolish their house without removing their 10 year old solar system (it was not cost effective for them to re-install). Luckily for us they said that if we could take it down we could have it! Erny clambered onto the roof on a balmy Sunday day to bring the panels down.\nOn the shopping front we spent hours online trawling for a dealer that would sell us heavy-duty fiction awning hinges for our loft and kitchen windows. For context, we will have three awning windows in the house that open outwards from the window sill1.\nAn example of an awning window\nA friction hinge allows the opening part of the window to stay open or ajar for long periods of time2. This is handy if you want to open the window for airflow or escape from a fire (priorities aye?). Frictionless hinges would have the opening portion of the window fall back into its closed position quickly.\nBut because awning windows are currently not in fashion it was really hard to find the a vendor, and worse still - because our double glass is heavy it was virtually impossible to find options that could take the weight of the glass. We ended up going with a commercial style which is a little less than aesthetic but very sturdy.\nWe also spend way too long deciding what sort of latches we were going to use to close the windows shut and most importantly - what colour they should be. It turns out that with awning windows one can only use one type of latch. These are called wedge fasteners and Lys couldn\u0026rsquo;t - for the life of her - find a good example of how they should be installed. Luckily the lovely team at Restoration Online were so helpful and stepped Lys through all things fasteners. We opted for polished brass across all fixtures, because it looks pretty and is quite popular meaning we may be able to snag some second hand deals if some unfortunate renovator accidentally purchases the incorrect size/amount.\nIf you ever wanted to know how wedge fasteners work\nAs a side note - if you ever are in the market for fixtures (think door handles, window fixings, locks or gate hooks) there seems to be only one player in the Australian market and that is TradCo (unless you go with something particularly boutique). We only say this because all online offerings look the same. Heck - some even call the TradCo products fancy names but use the same stock photos as the TradCo online PDF pamphlet3. It\u0026rsquo;s not a bad thing but it is difficult as a consumer to compare and contrast if everything is exactly the same.\nWe also played around with the second-hand router that Lys found off facebook marketplace for a steal.\nHighlights Getting the solar panels was such a huge highlight. Erny says that compared to the current market these solar panels would be about 60% as efficient but a new suite of panels (+ installation) would be approximately $4000 so it seems unfair to compare. We also did not expect to get solar so soon - if at all - so it was a nice win. ☀️ Side note: made a short vid (with gentle encouragement from a friendly social media savvy human - looking at you Lydia! 😄)\nChallenges We snapped a few more drill bits and need to purchase an 18v drill. Currently we have a 12v and a 9v but drilling pilot holes through the blackbutt is proving difficult. We\u0026rsquo;re also filling up a lot of our mistakes so another order of wood filler may be required.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next? Lys is desperate to finish a window. Just one would be nice\u0026hellip;\nCatch ya later, Lys \u0026amp; Erny\nWindow sketch up credits\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nIf for some reason you want to learn about torque on friction hinges: go here\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nCheck out pretty door handles in the TradCo pamphlet\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","href":"/themiette/posts/oct-2022-build-update/","title":"Oct Build Update"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/solar/","title":"solar"},{"content":"An August September build update Hello Spring! Working almost every weekend, these last two months we\u0026rsquo;ve actually got a proper build update 😄.\nTable Of Contents\rWhat we\u0026rsquo;ve done Highlights Challenges What\u0026rsquo;s next? What we\u0026rsquo;ve done We went through our stash of 90x45mm lengths and picked out roof rafters. These have been measured down to a 20 degree angle and some have been cut to size! We\u0026rsquo;ve been doing this in the garage when there has been a rain shower break and it has worked quite well. Erny created a little jig to speed up the process and it has been great get that out of the way.\nWorking in the garage cutting window rafters\nThen we spent 3 whole days stripping the faces of our cedar cladding boards. Originally, we were going to use paint stripper and scrape the old paint off but we found that method too slow. By shearing the face off the boards we can get to the beautiful grain quickly, but it does substantially decrease the thickness down from 19mm to 15mm, which is just enough to continue using the pieces as cladding. We still need to cut out to extend the tongue and grooves of each piece (there are about 70 3m pieces to fix up) but that\u0026rsquo;s a future problem. It is truly a labour of love refurbishing this cladding but we think it will be worth it! Western Red Cedar is often $30 - $40 per lineal meter as it is not grown in Australian plantations and so we are very lucky to have found some at no cost on the secondary market (good work Erny!).\nStripping western red cedar cladding\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve finally tweaked and re-tweaked our design for our custom windows. We are kind of following a process similar to Project Kamp - they made a comprehensive video about their window journey which you can watch below.\nLike Project Kamp, we are also using double glazed windows (see our post on our recent-ish trip to Canberra) but we are using Blackbutt frames. We also purchased EPDM414 self adhesive window tape from Clark Rubber to keep our windows water and air tight. Clark Rubber is this rubber and pool store in Australia that has a bright yellow platypus as its logo - Honestly Lys had never been to Clark Rubber before and it was just a random experience. Who knew that there were so many rubber products available to the retail market?\nThen our much awaited week of leave came around! We spent most of our week off machining these window frames down to size and cutting channels and beading. Honestly this was pretty slow going - measuring, cutting, re-measuring our mistakes but we are definitely closer to putting our glass into the frames.\nCutting window pieces to size\nFinished window pieces\nFeature Window (our biggest window) Pieces\nFinally, our finishing oil and putty came in the mail and Lys is excited to use some new products. We are going to protect our blackbutt frames with an product from Osmo - UV Protection Oil1. This stuff is literally the good oil - being easy to prepare, easy to apply and easy to maintain. It is also made of natural oils (sunflower oil, soya oil, thistle oil and linseed oil) and has lower amounts of volatile chemicals.\nThe only down side to this product is that we had to ship it from Queensland! It seems that there are no retailers in our state who stock this product at an affordable price\u0026hellip;\nHighlights We got another extension cord! This may not sound like much but we have been working on one singular powerpoint. Having another extension cord means that we can use (wait for it\u0026hellip;) a whopping two power tools at the same time. It\u0026rsquo;s the little things that bring joy you know?\nChallenges Our week off came with a few challenges! The few days prior Lys religiously checked the weather forecast every hour on the hour to see what our prospects were for full days of work. Luckily the forecast was more conservative than usual and we managed to get over 8 hours of work in per day.\nWe also had a few issues with our very faithful Makita table saw and tool set. We were making some cross cuts on the table saw and discovered that NOTHING was square. It turns out that the set square the we had been using was out by 1mm. This isn\u0026rsquo;t an issue when we are working on larger longer pieces (e.g cladding) but is a positive nightmare when it comes to woodworking that requires more finesse (cough the windows). To remediate, we set off for an emergency (and actually square) set square which made our lives a whole lot easier (and more accurate). We also discovered the benefits - and it sounds a little silly - to cleaning the table saw blade. We were experiencing inconvenient friction burn marks on our blackbutt wood and our friend Silvia suggested that it may be time for a new blade or a quick clean. Taking pause to maintain our tools reduced the friction burn marks and allowed us to eek a few more cuts out of the old blade.\nGot somewhat distracted by all the Makita products\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next? Australia\u0026rsquo;s Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) has officially confirmed that we are heading into yet another La Niña, our 3rd consecutive wet Summer so honestly not feeling very hopeful. But slow progress is still progress so that is something.\nI am not crying about the rain are crying about the rain\nCatch ya later, Lys \u0026amp; Erny\nRead the technical specs of Osmo here\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","href":"/themiette/posts/aug-sep-2022-build-update/","title":"August September 2022 Build Update"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/cedar/","title":"cedar"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/cladding/","title":"cladding"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/tiny_house/","title":"tiny_house"},{"content":"Operation Find a Roof As Lys sits down to write this she can officially say that we have sourced all of our roof components! It is a mixture of second hand material and some first-hand non-negotiable(s) but it\u0026rsquo;s great to finally have all the bits and bobs.\nTable Of Contents\rThe Design The Material Gutters Sundry Items The Design We chose to have a slightly off centred gable roof for our tiny house. Technically this is known as a saltbox pitch style but we have not found that term used commonly in Australia. We wanted to keep the traditional house style compared to some of the more modern tiny house options. The style is also quite useful for maximising solar panels on a small space and this will be helpful if we decide to go off-grid. It is also simple to construct as there are minimal valleys or curves which makes it great for novice builders also known as cough us.\nOur roof design\nWe are going to have a roof pitch of 20 degrees (which is standard for most houses and easier to find second hand materials for) even though we could have as little as a 5 degree roof pitch for a gable roof. Most tiny houses choose a shed style or flat roof which is technically more space economical as one can get more internal head height but we really liked the more traditional aesthetic. There is just something so comfortable and cosy about a gable roof.\nGable, Saltbox, Flat and Shed roof styles are all common tiny house options\nThe Material Metal was our go to choice for a roof - it\u0026rsquo;s light, relatively affordable and easy to come by on the second hand market. Often larger jobs will order 10% extra as leeway and sell the remainder. We actually found our Colorbond from a lovely family fixing a shed, a elderly couple redoing a carport and a renovation on the Central Coast.\nOn our way up from the Central Coast we had this brilliant idea to cut the Colorbond panelling with tin snips to fit the sheets into the van. It turns out that it is incredibly difficult to cut corrugated iron with tin snips (think of these like scissors for metal) over long distances and most people just use a circular saw or angle grinder. Luckily we had a rope that Erny was given from another pick up and we bundled 6m pieces of Colorbond into the back of the van and tied the boot closed for a 1.5hr drive home. Note to self - always bring a circular saw!\nBut what about the colour?\nLys absolutely adores a dark coloured and black roof. It is the current tiny house trend at the moment and looks very sleek, blending into the the environment if it is particularly verdant. The building industry also loves a good dark roof as well1.\nThat being said - the colour is not the ideal colour in sunny Australia, or anywhere warm in this changing climate2. Long story short - dark coloured surfaces absorb more heat energy than lighter colours. In a roofing context this heats the roof cavity of your home and - unless you have great insulation - heats the interior of your home. On a broader scale, with urban sprawl suburbs can fall victim to the Urban Heat Island3 effect - where urban centers are significantly warmer than rural areas due to having less trees and more dark surfaces.\nAt one point in time Australian states were looking to ban dark coloured roofs on new developments.\nHaving said this - a tiny house roof is very small so in the grand scheme of things it probably won\u0026rsquo;t matter, but as Australia\u0026rsquo;s cities experience more urban sprawl it is more important than ever to make small steps to heat-proof abodes - and this means Lys must sacrifice her dark coloured roof.\nSo we are going with Surf Mist as our roof colour! Solar Absorptance (SA) is the proportion of the total incident solar radiation that is absorbed by the roofing material (the remainder is reflected) and a roof with a lower solar absorptance will absorb less heat than a roof with a higher solar absorptance. Theoretically, this should keep the roof space and building cooler on a hot day.\nSurfmist has a SA of 0.32 - compared to Monument (an incredibly popular tiny house roof colour) which has a SA of 0.71. Obviously if we had our time again we\u0026rsquo;d love to use Whitehaven or Dover White (SA of 0.23) but it seems like it is not available for retail consumers, rather it is an architectural offering only.\nClassic Colorbond Colours\nGutters We found the gutters in the Haberfield of all places. A heritage listed house had accidentally ordered the incorrect gutter type in the colour that we were looking for (Surfmist) and we pounced. We ended up getting them for free as well 😄 We actually ended up using the same rope to secure our gutters in the van - we suppose the real take away here is always bring a rope when picking up second hand construction items.\nTaking off gutters\nSundry Items It was most difficult trying to find flashing, ridge caps and rivets second hand. We ended up purchasing on the first-hand market (and rust is a thing so we thought this would be the best approach). This posed another problem as most suppliers are not interested in servicing such a small job or they are a full service fit out (i.e. they provide the product and the installation service). Other vendors wouldn\u0026rsquo;t match the existing gutters that we had or were not based in our state - shipping costs are a killer! Additionally, with rising construction costs website prices were inflated from 5% - 20% on the personalized quote.\nLuckily we found Jack from Roofit Online which had an online store (because as we know Millennials avoid talking on the phone like the plague) and 24/7 customer service. They specialise in Colorbond and locally manufacture. What they can\u0026rsquo;t make they source though their team based in NSW as well.They also take all types of jobs no matter how small which is great when building a tiny house. Jack was super patient and chucked a 5% discount - thanks Jack! We only have good things to say.\nSo here we are - one nerdy rant later about roof colours and we are a little bit closer to putting ours up!\nCatch ya later, Lys \u0026amp; Erny\nFind out why people like dark roofs with Renew\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nIf you feel extra nerdy Lys found this paper on roof performance around the world a great read\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nUrban Heat Island Effect is a term used to describe the outer suburbs of major cities with minimal tree cover.

We had been on the hunt for double glazed glass closer to home but it seems that Canberra - having cold winters - has great reclaimed glass options.\nTable Of Contents\rIntroducing Handyman Trading Post A side step antiquing So what\u0026rsquo;d you get? But why use double glazing?\nWeight is a huge issue in tiny house construction (we need to keep the building under 4.5 tonnes) and double glazed glass is notoriously heavy. This is fine for a traditional build but for tiny house construction builders often choose to install single paned glass. We chose double paned glass because firstly, Erny wanted this feature, but also because our windows will take a good percentage of our wall surface area. We\u0026rsquo;re also trying out a continuous band of insulation on top of insulation batting to reduce thermal bridging in light of Passive House design so it would be a pity to have insulated walls but have all our heat leak out of our windows. We\u0026rsquo;re also not planning on adding active heating mechanisms (e.g air-con) to the Miette if we have to so choosing double glazed windows seems like a good way to go for now.\nIntroducing Handyman Trading Post Handymans Trading Post specialises in used building materials and seems to be the only place that sells double glazed glass on the east coast. Erny found them on Facebook Marketplace and they were super friendly online. They recommended that we pop down in person to see their panes and even though they were in another state the trip was well worth it.\nThe Handyman Trading Post\nWindows everywhere!\nWhen we went in January, they had some great stock (which is what you get from over 41 years in business). They seem to have Australia\u0026rsquo;s collection cedar doors and window frames and some of the nicest stained glass windows too. You can find more about Handyman Trading Post here.\nCanberra has the best stock\nNote: they close at 1PM on Saturdays so if you are traveling from afar, factor this in! We arrived at 12:30 - just in time to pick up our glass.\nA side step antiquing There\u0026rsquo;s also a cute antique store named Down Memory Lane which is just opposite so we spent some time there checking out the wares.

It\u0026rsquo;s currently residing in Lys\u0026rsquo; office covered by a towel. Our kitchen window pane is a little larger than we anticipated coming in at (470x1200mm). We\u0026rsquo;ll have to manipulate our walls to fit this window into our design. We lucked out with our bathroom window as there was only a small selection of frosted glass options but we came away with a thin long window which we should be able to put frosted film on.\nFinally, we were super lucky to get two panes exactly the same dimensions for our loft windows (at 300x900mm)!\nCatch ya later, Lys \u0026amp; Erny\nArrive early if you\u0026rsquo;re traveling far\n","href":"/themiette/posts/a-quick-trip-to-canberra/","title":"A Quick Trip to Canberra"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/canberra/","title":"canberra"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/blackbutt/","title":"blackbutt"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/douglas_fir/","title":"douglas_fir"},{"content":"A June build update Decided that we should do monthly build updates as we march towards the end of the year. We\u0026rsquo;re hoping to reach lock up by then (walls, floor and roof complete) and 31st December is our D-day.\nTable Of Contents\rWhat we\u0026rsquo;ve done Challenges What\u0026rsquo;s next? What we\u0026rsquo;ve done Erny bought a second hand table saw for $400 a few months back and it\u0026rsquo;s been an absolute workhorse. With it we\u0026rsquo;ve milled our wood down to size (70x45mm) for our walls and have started cutting down the blackbutt for our window frames.\nWorking with a job site table (one that\u0026rsquo;s portable) saw has meant there have been a few tweaks that we\u0026rsquo;ve had to make. The first is that the vibrations and when one rips though a particularly long length of wood the fence is prone to shifting. Erny hacked a wood piece to clamp on to the table saw to minimise this.\nMilling douglas fir to size\nAnother is that the vibrations move the table saw forward on the table that we\u0026rsquo;re using. Once again clamps come to our rescue as we decided to clamp down two pieces of wood to the end of the table. These act as a stopper to stop the table saw shifting.\nCutting blackbutt to size\nSomething else that we\u0026rsquo;ve noticed is how good douglas fir smells. Apparently it smells like citrus but it just smells really fragrant. And as a soft wood it\u0026rsquo;s super light! Douglas fir is considered one of the most resilient softwoods in the commercial market and can handle really hard conditions. You\u0026rsquo;ll find it in older style houses or in large beams. Apparently, it was the go-to wood in the 19th century and was milled in all over Sydney. Now, apparently, Australia goes for treated pine for its lumber material as its quicker to grow and Douglas fir is less available. Our lumber comes from a timber mill that was closing down to make way for apartments and off cuts from a housing renovation.\nBlackbutt is our wood of choice to frame our windows with Erny having the bright idea to make the window frames himself. It\u0026rsquo;s a ridiculously heavy native hardwood that has a gorgeous grain and colour. We picked up the planks at an auction house to save them from getting mulched as they have quite a few cracks and burls in them (or as some people like to say - character). It also smells different to the Douglas fir when it gets sawn - because it\u0026rsquo;s a hardwood. Since Blackbutt is so dense it causes the blade to heat up due to increased friction. This burns the wood and brings out a more burnt smell.\nWood Density Notes Douglas Fir 550kg/m3 Softwood Blackbutt 900kg/m3 Hardwood Also, we\u0026rsquo;re following part of the Unified Construction Method by Fred Schultz, by creating ply connectors for our roof rafters and have measured 23 of these out. Lys had to hunt high and low for a protractor that hadn\u0026rsquo;t been touched since Year 6 Maths.\nChallenges We\u0026rsquo;ve had a string of pretty good weekends in June so can\u0026rsquo;t complain about the weather! ☀️🌧️ A thing we\u0026rsquo;re trying to tweak at the moment is finding fastest and most optimal way to set up our workspace since we\u0026rsquo;re working outside. Currently we\u0026rsquo;re putting out two fold out tables and using some spare agriculture pipe to manage particles.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next? Erny\u0026rsquo;s flying out to the US for most of July and the forecast is looking pretty awful so it\u0026rsquo;s unlikely that we\u0026rsquo;ll be getting much done this month. We\u0026rsquo;ll probably be writing up a bit more content as well catching everyone up on what we\u0026rsquo;ve been up to over the last 6 months too!\nCatch ya later, Lys \u0026amp; Erny\n","href":"/themiette/posts/june-2022-build-update/","title":"June 2022 Build Update"},{"content":"Definition: miette [/mjɛt/] nom féminin\nA crumb, fragment or small amount.

Think of a tool library like a library for books but instead of literature, movies and audio, you hire things! The Inner West Tool Library is an amazing place to borrow tools for the week and worked perfectly for us. At the tool library we rented:\nAir compressor Finishing nail gun Check out their wider inventory here.

Do you have any constraints? What does miette mean? So how\u0026rsquo;s it going? Why build a tiny house? Erny and I have always been interested in living more sustainably and living small. Then a pandemic hit and it seemed like a good idea to get started on making the dream a reality.\nDo you have any constraints? We\u0026rsquo;re trying to do everything (bar trailer, electrical and plumbing) ourselves.\nOther constraints include:\nBuying second hand or borrowing tools (from tool libraries and benevolent friends) Going for second, reclaimed and recycled materials first (thank you Facebook marketplace ❤️) Having limited construction knowledge (however we have some amazing friends who do!) Working full time jobs with no plans on quitting them We\u0026rsquo;re also following the building principles of Fred\u0026rsquo;s Tiny Houses and his Unified Construction Method and Passive Haus Design principles.\nWhat does miette mean? Miette is the french word for crumb or morsel. We chose it as we share a love of pastries, bread and all things that create tiny dust carbs but also because crumbs (like our budget) are small - like our tiny house! We also love the colour yellow - you\u0026rsquo;ll often see Erny running about in a yellow raincoat.\nOther names that we bounced around included:\nLe petit chou (the little cabbage) Wanda Inn The Blue Elephant Half Bark House Block House (after our favourite climbing gym) So how\u0026rsquo;s it going? It\u0026rsquo;s going very slooooooooooooooowly.
