      <description>Happy 2025! We hope you&amp;rsquo;ve had a restful festive season ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ‰. Time doesnâ€™t just fly â€” it seems to sprint when youâ€™re building a tiny house. Going to pack updates for October, November, and December in this build update, thereâ€™s been a lot more construction than reflection and writing. But, as we reminisce on the past three months, itâ€™s clear how much weâ€™ve accomplished, as we continue to chip away at our goals.</description>

      <description>Hello! Itâ€™s another double month build update, not by design but by necessity as we have been working hard to make this tiny house more of a reality. June saw us work on our kitchen cabinets while we wait for the professionals and buying an HRV system, and July saw us getting all our insulation done! We watched many hours of Tour de France and as Lys writes this the Olympics is on in the background, so we are feeling very inspired watching others achieve their goals.</description>

      <description>Well hello there, long time no write. Not really sure where all the time went, but letâ€™s start in February and make our way through the months, shall we?
