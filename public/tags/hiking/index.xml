      <description>News flash: our house is now an appliance!
Just kidding — but it has started to feel that way with the electrics coming online this month and once again, we know it&amp;rsquo;s August, and last build update was in May but we&amp;rsquo;ve been really trying to make serious progress this build. We also know that we had a planned move in date for May&amp;hellip;and that did not happen obviously.
But why is the tiny house an appliance?</description>

      <description>Oh, heyyyy long time no see&amp;hellip;it’s been a little while since we’ve updated you all — five months, to be exact! Between travelling, working, and chipping away at the house, the blog has definitely fallen to the wayside, but we’re back with plenty to share. Let’s dive into what’s been keeping us busy over the past few months. Spoiler alert: we’ve made progress, but as usual our timeline has been blown out of the window.</description>
