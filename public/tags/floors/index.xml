      <description>News flash: our house is now an appliance!
Just kidding â€” but it has started to feel that way with the electrics coming online this month and once again, we know it&amp;rsquo;s August, and last build update was in May but we&amp;rsquo;ve been really trying to make serious progress this build. We also know that we had a planned move in date for May&amp;hellip;and that did not happen obviously.
But why is the tiny house an appliance?</description>
