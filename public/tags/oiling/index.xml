      <description>News flash: our house is now an appliance!
Just kidding â€” but it has started to feel that way with the electrics coming online this month and once again, we know it&amp;rsquo;s August, and last build update was in May but we&amp;rsquo;ve been really trying to make serious progress this build. We also know that we had a planned move in date for May&amp;hellip;and that did not happen obviously.
But why is the tiny house an appliance?</description>

      <description>A July build update Windows are in!
Table Of ContentsWhat we&amp;rsquo;ve done Working on the water pooling solution Whatâ€™s next? What we&amp;rsquo;ve done July has been window month. We are pretty proud to say that we&amp;rsquo;ve now got our hand made windows installed ðŸ™‚ - here is how it went!
We began with the bathroom window, which we thought would be a breeze. However, not even one window down we faced our first hiccup - it turns out the width of the window frame was not wide enough to run flush with the internal lining of the tiny house (on the inside) and flush with the exterior cladding on the outside.</description>
