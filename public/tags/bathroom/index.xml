      <description>Oh, heyyyy long time no see&amp;hellip;itâ€™s been a little while since weâ€™ve updated you all â€” five months, to be exact! Between travelling, working, and chipping away at the house, the blog has definitely fallen to the wayside, but weâ€™re back with plenty to share. Letâ€™s dive into whatâ€™s been keeping us busy over the past few months. Spoiler alert: weâ€™ve made progress, but as usual our timeline has been blown out of the window.</description>

      <description>Happy 2025! We hope you&amp;rsquo;ve had a restful festive season ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ‰. Time doesnâ€™t just fly â€” it seems to sprint when youâ€™re building a tiny house. Going to pack updates for October, November, and December in this build update, thereâ€™s been a lot more construction than reflection and writing. But, as we reminisce on the past three months, itâ€™s clear how much weâ€™ve accomplished, as we continue to chip away at our goals.</description>

      <description>My goodness hasnâ€™t it been a time â€” feels like we havenâ€™t written a post in a long time. Looking back, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe how quickly time has flown by. April and May seem like distant memories, and now, here we are, well into&amp;hellip;July. But we havenâ€™t been sleeping and not working â€” let me take you through the latest updates and progress we&amp;rsquo;ve made during these transformative months.</description>
